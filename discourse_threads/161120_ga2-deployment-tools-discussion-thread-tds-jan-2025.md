That's a digital image of a simple smiley-face emoticon. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a circular yellow emoji with a subtle gradient, appearing slightly darker in the center and lighter at the edges.

* **Facial Features:** It has two small, dark brown, almost black, dots for eyes and a subtly curved, small line for a mouth, suggesting a pleasant, content, or slightly reserved expression.  The mouth is a thin, slightly upturned arc. There's no other detail like eyebrows or nose.

* **Style:** The style is very simple, almost minimalist, and reminiscent of early emoticons or simple graphic representations of a happy face.  The edges are somewhat pixelated, giving a slight digital appearance, suggesting it might be a raster graphic.


The overall impression is one of simple, uncomplicated happiness or contentment.

i have included the email address still its giving error
The image shows a code editor or terminal window displaying a question and an error message. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible information:

* **Question:** The top line asks, "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`"  This is a prompt requesting the correct URL format for a GitHub Pages site.

* **Empty Input Field:** Below the question is a blank text input field, likely where the user was supposed to enter their answer.  There is a small red circled exclamation mark to the right, suggesting an error or warning.

* **Error Message:** Below the input field is an error message: "Error: 22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response: ...". This indicates that a specific URL or identifier (the email-like string) wasn't found in the response from a server or webpage.

* **HTML Snippet:** The error message is followed by a partial snippet of HTML code. This code shows some basic HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<meta>`, `<title>`, `<style>`), suggesting the error might be related to the contents or structure of an HTML document. The snippet also reveals some styling information (`font-family`, `background-color`, `color`, `text-align`).

In short, the image demonstrates a problem where a user is trying to determine the URL of a GitHub Pages site, but receives an error indicating that a particular identifier is missing from the expected response.  The error is likely related to the server or the contents of the website itself.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a code snippet within a dark-themed code editor or terminal.  The top line is a question:  `What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. This provides context, indicating the user is trying to determine the correct URL for a Vercel application.

Below, there's an input field (or similar UI element) that contains a URL: `https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api`. This appears to be the user's attempt at providing the Vercel URL.  The URL is correctly formatted according to the example given.

Finally, at the bottom, an error message is displayed: `TypeError: Failed to fetch`. This suggests that there's a problem accessing or retrieving data from the URL provided.  The error likely originates from a JavaScript fetch request attempting to connect to this Vercel endpoint and failing.

The overall context strongly suggests a debugging scenario where the user is troubleshooting a web application deployed on Vercel, and is encountering a problem fetching data from the application's API.

@carlton can you please tell me what is wrong in this because I am getting “Error: Response undefined does not match expected” to my answer
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a macOS screen displaying several windows and applications. The main focus is on a code editor (likely VS Code or similar) showing Python code using the FastAPI framework.  The code defines an API endpoint `/api` that retrieves student data from a CSV file.  It includes CORS middleware for handling cross-origin requests and allows filtering students by class.

**Key elements of the image:**

* **Code Editor (left):** This window prominently displays the Python code, which is the core subject of the image.  The code is well-commented, indicating the purpose of different sections.

* **Terminal (top right):** A terminal window shows output indicating the successful running of a Uvicorn server, a popular ASGI server for Python web applications. The output includes HTTP requests and responses, confirming the API is working.  The server is listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

* **Web Browser (bottom right):** A web browser window displays a simple webpage, likely a testing interface for the API.  It has sections for "Verify," "Image," and "Upload," suggesting that the API might handle file uploads or image processing in addition to data retrieval.  The text "You should see output indicating that Uvicorn is" suggests this page is for testing the server's functionality.

* **Dock (bottom):** A macOS dock is visible at the bottom, showing various applications including a web browser (Chrome), mail client, and other commonly used apps.

* **File Name (top left):** The code editor window shows "main.py" in a tab, which indicates the name of the Python file containing the API code.

**Overall:**

The image shows a developer working on a FastAPI application.  The combination of code, server output, and a simple test webpage shows a complete workflow for building and testing an API. The focus is on the Python code and its interaction with a Uvicorn server.

Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok  

image1920×886 45.7 KB

  
I tired multiple times but issue is still there.  
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Kindly help me out.
The image shows a ngrok error message.  The error is `ERR_NGROK_8012`.

The error message states that traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at `http://localhost:8080`. The error encountered was a connection refused error.

A diagram shows the flow of traffic from the internet, through the ngrok edge and agent, to the user's service. The connection to the user's service is marked with a red X, indicating the failure.

The message provides troubleshooting steps for both developers and visitors.

**For Developers:**  It suggests checking if a web service is running on `http://localhost:8080` and offers links to help documentation.

**For Visitors:**  It advises waiting a few minutes and refreshing the page, or contacting the developer if the problem persists.

The error strongly suggests that the application running on `localhost:8080` is either not running, misconfigured, or not accessible to the ngrok agent, despite the agent successfully receiving the traffic.  The `connection refused` error indicates a problem on the server-side, specifically that the service isn't listening on the port specified.

Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`

So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see response for that `1S` class only.

kind regards

Hi Guddu,

Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

kind regards.

I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.

Docker Desktop Error558×377 27 KB

I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).

wsl --version

```
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011

```

Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.  
So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a Docker Desktop error message. 


**Error Message Details:**

* **Title:** "Docker Desktop - Unexpected WSL error"  This indicates a problem with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
* **Main Error Text:** "An unexpected error occurred while executing a WSL command." This is a general error, lacking specific details.
* **Troubleshooting Steps:** The message suggests two main actions:
    * Shut down WSL using the command `wsl --shutdown`.
    * Reboot the machine.
* **Additional Troubleshooting:** It also suggests reinstalling WSL and/or Docker Desktop as a further troubleshooting step.
* **Reporting the Issue:** The message includes a link to "collect diagnostics and submit an issue," implying the user can send more detailed information to Docker for further investigation.
* **Specific Error:** A detailed error message shows a failed attempt to deploy WSL2 distributions.  The line "importing WSL distro "WSL2 is not supported with" strongly suggests an incompatibility issue.
* **Buttons:**  The window contains buttons labelled "Gather diagnostics" and "Quit". The "Gather diagnostics" button allows the user to collect diagnostic data to help in resolving the problem. The "Quit" button closes the error message window.
* **Policy Link:** There is a link to "Read our policy for uploaded diagnostic data," which is standard for data privacy and security.


**Overall:** The image displays a clear error message with troubleshooting steps. The error seems to be related to Docker Desktop's inability to use WSL2 due to incompatibility.  The user has options to attempt troubleshooting steps or collect diagnostic logs to help Docker support resolve the issue.

Hi Telvin,

Try opening `localhost:8080` in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

@Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop.

Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

@22f2001640 in that case

* a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
* a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

* Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
* GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested

You *could* try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.

* **Shape and Color:** It's a circle, predominantly yellow, resembling a classic smiley face.  The yellow is a warm, slightly golden tone.

* **Features:** It has two small, dark brown (or possibly black) dots for eyes and a small, subtly curved line for a mouth, suggesting a mild, contented expression. The mouth isn't a wide, exaggerated grin, but a small, understated upturned curve.

* **Style:** The style is simple and cartoonish, typical of emojis or emoticons used in digital communication.  The edges are slightly softened, not perfectly sharp.

* **Background:** The background is transparent, allowing it to be placed on any background without a noticeable border.

In short, it's a basic, cheerful smiley face emoji.

This image shows a code editor or terminal window displaying an error message related to a GitHub Pages URL. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible information:

* **Top Line:**  The question "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/" is displayed. This indicates the user is trying to determine the correct URL for their GitHub Pages site.  The `[USER]` and `[REPO]` are placeholders for the actual username and repository name.

* **Input Field:** A text input field is partially visible, likely where the user was to enter their GitHub Pages URL.  The field appears to be empty or contains redacted information. There is a warning indicator (a circle with an exclamation mark) to the right of the field, suggesting there's a problem with the input or the underlying process.

* **Error Message:** Below the input field, an error message is shown.  A portion of the error message reads: "Error: 22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response:". This suggests that a specific address (22f3001315@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) is not found in the response from the server, possibly because it's not the correct GitHub Pages URL.

* **Partial HTML Snippet:** Following the error message is a partial snippet of HTML code. This code appears to be the beginning of an HTML file, including:
    * A DOCTYPE declaration
    * HTML and head tags
    * Metadata about character set and viewport settings
    * A title tag: `<title>Dolphin Facts</title>`
    * A style tag containing some basic CSS for body text formatting


The overall context indicates the user encountered an issue while attempting to access or verify their GitHub Pages website. The error message points to a problem with the provided address, and the partial HTML reveals some of the content of the webpage itself.  The error is likely related to an incorrect or improperly configured URL for the GitHub Pages site.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Line:** This line is a prompt or instruction asking for a Vercel URL. It provides an example format: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`.

* **Middle Section:** This section shows a text input field where a URL is entered. The inputted URL is `https://markdarshan.vercel.app/api`.

* **Bottom Line:** An error message is displayed: `TypeError: Failed to fetch`. This suggests that there was a problem retrieving data from the provided Vercel URL.


The overall context suggests the user is attempting to access or test an API deployed on Vercel. The error indicates that the fetch operation failed, possibly due to network issues, incorrect URL, or server-side problems.

Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 1.39.39 AM1440×900 154 KB

  
@carlton can you please tell me what is wrong in this because I am getting “Error: Response undefined does not match expected” to my answer
The image shows a macOS screen displaying a Python FastAPI application running with Uvicorn. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Left (Main Window):** A code editor shows a Python file (`main.py`) defining a FastAPI application.  The code reads a CSV file containing student data, sets up CORS middleware to allow requests from all origins, and defines an API endpoint (`/api`) that returns student data.  The endpoint allows optional filtering by class.

* **Top Right (Terminal):** A terminal window shows the output of running the Uvicorn server.  The output includes startup messages, indication of the server listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, and log entries showing successful GET requests to the `/api` endpoint with and without class parameters.  The successful requests indicate the API is functioning correctly. The `-reload` flag is also visible in the uvicorn command, which means the server restarts automatically if the code is changed.

* **Bottom Right (Web Browser):** A web browser window appears to be a simple UI for interacting with the API.  The text "API application using Uvicorn:" is visible, suggesting a rudimentary interface for testing the API endpoint. There are buttons for verifying, and image upload functionality, though no further details are readily apparent.

* **Dock:**  The macOS dock at the bottom shows various applications, including Chrome, Mail, and others.


The overall context suggests a developer is creating and testing a simple REST API using FastAPI, Uvicorn, and a CSV file as a data source. The combination of code, terminal output, and web interface provides a comprehensive view of the development and testing process.

Facing Issue in GA 2 Question 10 LLM ngrok  

image1920×886 45.7 KB

  
I tired multiple times but issue is still there.  
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand Kindly help me out.
The image shows a ngrok error message.  The error code is `ERR_NGROK_8012`.  The message explains that traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to connect to the upstream web service running at `http://localhost:8080`. The underlying error was a connection refused.

A diagram above the error message shows the flow of traffic: Internet -> ngrok Edge -> ngrok Agent -> (X) Your Service.  The 'X' indicates where the failure occurred.

The error message provides instructions for both developers and visitors:

**For developers:** The message instructs them to verify that a web service is running on `http://localhost:8080`. They should try accessing this address via cURL or a browser to confirm the service is working correctly.  It also provides a link to documentation for further assistance.

**For visitors:** The message suggests waiting a few minutes and refreshing the page. If the problem persists, contacting the page's developer is suggested.

In short, the image shows a typical ngrok connection failure where the ngrok agent itself is functioning but the local application it's trying to forward traffic to isn't responding.

Hi Mishkat,

Please use triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.

eg

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

```

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.

Thanks and kind regards

Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`

So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see response for that `1S` class only.

kind regards

Hi Guddu,

Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

kind regards.

I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.

Docker Desktop Error558×377 27 KB

I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).

wsl --version

```
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011

```

Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.  
So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?
The image shows an error message from Docker Desktop. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Title:** "Docker Desktop - Unexpected WSL error"  This indicates a problem with Docker Desktop's interaction with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

* **Error Description:** "An unexpected error occurred while executing a WSL command." This is a general error, not very specific.

* **Troubleshooting Steps:** The message suggests two main solutions:
    * Shut down WSL using the command `wsl --shutdown` and then reboot the machine.
    * Reinstall both WSL and Docker Desktop.

* **Further Action:** If the problem persists, the user is prompted to "collect diagnostics and submit an issue." A link is provided for this action.

* **Detailed Error Log:** A section below shows a more technical error message:
    * "deploying WSL2 distributions"
    * "ensuring main distro is deployed: deploying "docker-desktop": importing WSL distro "WSL2 is not supported with"  This suggests the Docker Desktop installation is attempting to use a WSL2 distribution, which isn't compatible.

* **Buttons:** There are two buttons at the bottom:
    * "Gather diagnostics" allows the user to collect diagnostic information to help troubleshoot.
    * "Quit" closes the error message window.

* **Policy Link:** A link to the policy regarding uploaded diagnostic data is visible at the bottom.


In summary, the image depicts a specific error within Docker Desktop related to its inability to utilize WSL2.  The error message provides steps to troubleshoot, including gathering diagnostics for further support.

Hi Telvin,

Try opening `localhost:8080` in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

@Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop.

Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

@22f2001640 in that case

* a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
* a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

* Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
* GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested

You *could* try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.

Thank you, Sir!

> What is the Docker image URL? It should look like: `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general`

If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?

@carlton my answer got excepted before but now it is only working on the terminal after I modified the code but when I paste the url in the answer box it is again showing error
The image shows a macOS screen with several applications open, primarily focused on a web browser and a terminal window. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Web Browser (Top Right):** Displays a graded assignment webpage.  The assignment involves a Flask/FastAPI backend. The instructions require the API to handle query parameters (`class`) to filter student data based on their class. It specifies that the returned data should maintain the order from the CSV file, and requires CORS to be enabled. The URL endpoint for the FastAPI is provided, and there's a section displaying an error response from the API, showing a JSON array of student objects.  The assignment is due on January 26th, 2025. The current score is 5.5/10.

* **Web Browser (Top Left):** Shows another browser window making GET requests to the API endpoint `/api?class=1` and `/api?class=15`, with a successful response (JSON data) shown in the `Pretty print` section.  These requests are to test the API functionality.

* **Terminal (Bottom Left):** Displays a terminal window showing the output of a Python program (`Python main.py`), likely the FastAPI server. It shows numerous GET and OPTIONS requests (likely preflight CORS requests) made to the API with various query parameters.  The responses indicate successful requests (`200 OK`).

* **Dock (Bottom):** The macOS dock at the bottom of the screen shows various applications including Chrome (the web browser), Mail, Messages, and other icons.

* **Other:**  A small window titled "Graded Assign" is visible behind one of the web browsers, further emphasizing that the user is working on a graded assignment.

In essence, the image depicts a student working on a coding assignment involving building and testing a FastAPI backend that serves student data based on specified class parameters. The displayed error in the web browser indicates a problem with the API's current response format; it is likely this error that prevented the student from achieving a full score.

Hi Mishkat,

The GA url encoded parameter is `class`  
In your screenshot, you are using `class_`  
Your code that we examined earlier also accepts `class_` as the parameter instead of `class` as required by the GA  
The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter `class`

@s.anand @carlton I am facing this issue i have run the entire thing thrice but still i am facing this issue, what should I do?
The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying an error message from ngrok.  Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top of the Screen:**

* **Browser Tabs:**  Multiple browser tabs are visible, suggesting various applications or websites are open.  Relevant tabs include "Graded Ass," "GA2-Depic," "TDS 2025," "Llama-3.2," "AI Chat," "Push Dock," "(5) Whats," and "Tunnel Agent."  The active tab displays the ngrok error page.
* **Address Bar:** Shows the ngrok URL: `9eab-2402-6280-3e1e-193-508b-9d2e-a630-931c.ngrok-free.app`

**Main Content:**

* **ngrok Status Diagram:** A diagram with four sections depicts the flow of traffic.  "Internet," "ngrok Edge," "ngrok Agent" show green check marks, while "Your Service" has a red 'x' indicating the failure point.
* **Error Message (ERR_NGROK_8012):** This is the primary focus. The message indicates that traffic successfully reached the ngrok agent but failed to connect to the upstream web service running locally on port 5000 (`http://localhost:5000`). The error details show a connection refused error.
* **Troubleshooting Section:** The page provides instructions for both developers and visitors.
    * **For Developers:** Advises to ensure a web service is running on `http://localhost:5000` and to check ngrok's documentation.
    * **For Visitors:** Suggests waiting a few minutes and refreshing the page, or contacting the developer if the problem persists.
* **Powered by ngrok:**  A small footer at the bottom indicates the platform used.

**Overall:** The error is a classic connection problem. The ngrok tunnel is working, but the application or service running locally on port 5000 (`http://localhost:5000`) is either not running, not listening on the correct port, or has a firewall blocking the connection.  The screenshot offers helpful troubleshooting steps.

Hi Mishkat,

In your code, the word `class` is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing `class_` to `class` is not going to work. The *only* thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api *not* the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.

Kind regards

Hi Team ,

For GA - 2 , Question 6:  
I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel.  
And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.

But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.  

Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 6.58.43 PM3570×1344 436 KB

I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “\*” for allowing request from any origin.

I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal.  
Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here.

Thanks  
Kushagra
The image shows a series of screenshots, primarily from a web browser's developer tools and a code editor. The content suggests a programming assignment or tutorial involving:

**1. Vercel Deployment and API Creation:**

*   The top section describes instructions to create a Python application and deploy it to Vercel.  The application should expose an API endpoint that accepts two names (X and Y) as parameters and returns a JSON response containing their respective marks (example: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`).

*   A partially obscured Vercel URL (`https://vercel...shagra-barodekars-projects...`) is displayed, showing an attempt to access the API, which resulted in a `TypeError: NetworkError` - indicating a problem with the API deployment or access.

*   The code snippet shows the expected JSON response format.


**2. Network Tab (Browser Developer Tools):**

*   The bottom half showcases the "Network" tab of browser developer tools, displaying a series of HTTP requests (GET and POST).  The `200 OK` status of a GET request suggests a successful response from the API, but its URL is partially obscured.  The `Missing Allow Origin` suggests a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue - the server might not be configured to allow requests from the origin making the request.

**3. GitHub Actions:**

*   The text "Create a GitHub Action (1.5 marks)" indicates a requirement to automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions.

**In summary:** The image shows a student working on a programming assignment that requires deploying a Python API to Vercel and setting up a GitHub Action for automated deployment. There are apparent issues with the API's deployment (NetworkError) and potentially CORS configuration (Missing Allow Origin). The partially obscured URLs make it difficult to provide precise solutions, but the error messages are very indicative of the problems encountered.

Hello, this is working when I put in parameters, but not when I submit on quiz portal. What to do?
The image shows a screen capture of a web application or form where the user is prompted to enter a Vercel URL. The prompt clearly states that the URL should follow the format `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`.  Below the prompt is a text input field where the user has entered `https://your-app2.vercel.app/api`.  This URL is almost identical to the example, the only difference being the "2" added to "app."

Below the input field, an error message is displayed: `TypeError: Failed to fetch`. This error suggests that the application was unable to retrieve data from the URL provided, indicating a possible issue with the URL itself or a problem with the server responding to requests at that URL.  A small circled "i" icon is also present next to the input field, suggesting there might be more information or context available upon clicking it.

Hi Aindree,

I tried to send a request to your application `https://your-app2.vercel.app/api` with url encoded parameter `class=7Q`. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends `{"marks": []}`.

Check if your csv file is correct. Also check if code is correct.

Kind regards

For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

Hi Tushar,

For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.

For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.

For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.

Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.

image830×156 10.3 KB
The image shows a screenshot of a web page interface element. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Instruction:** At the top, it says "Upload your losslessly compressed image (less than 1,500 bytes)". This indicates that the user is expected to upload an image file that has been compressed without any loss of image quality and that the file size should be less than 1500 bytes.

* **File Upload Control:** Below the instruction, there's a file upload control.  "Choose File" is a button that allows the user to select a file from their computer. Next to it, "shapes_compressed.png" shows the name of a file that has already been selected.

* **Error Message:** At the bottom, a red error message reads "Error: Could not process image. Is it a browser-supported image? Image pixels do not match the original." This suggests that the uploaded image file "shapes_compressed.png," while seemingly meeting the size requirement, has an issue that prevents the system from processing it. The error message suggests two potential reasons:  the image format might not be supported by the browser, or the dimensions (pixels) of the uploaded file are different from the original image it's supposed to replace.

In short, the screenshot displays an unsuccessful image upload due to a compatibility or pixel mismatch issue.

The image shows a code editor or similar interface with text instructions and a partially filled-in input field.  The main task is to create and deploy a Python application to Vercel that exposes an API.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Instructions:** The top section provides instructions to download a JSON file (`q-vercel-python.json`) containing student marks.  It then details the requirements to create a Python application deployed on Vercel, which should respond to API requests (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y`) with a JSON response containing the marks for names X and Y.  An example JSON response structure is given: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.

* **Vercel URL Input:** There's a question asking for the Vercel URL.  The expected format is `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. An input field below provides a user-entered URL: `https://student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects-f2a54030.vercel.app/api`.  This seems to be the solution provided by the user.

* **Error Message:** At the very bottom, an error message is displayed: `TypeError: Failed to fetch`. This suggests that the deployed application or the provided URL is not functioning correctly, or there's an issue with retrieving data from it.


In summary, the image depicts a coding challenge or assignment where the user is asked to build and deploy a Python API to Vercel, and it shows their attempted solution along with an error indicating a problem in the process.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a browser window displaying a JSON response. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Browser Address Bar:** The address bar shows a URL that points to an API endpoint likely for student marks. The URL includes a project name ("student-marks-gb9zwxnfx-tushars-projects"), a Vercel app deployment ("f2a54030.vercel.app"), and query parameters related to a student's name. The name appears to be encoded or obfuscated.

* **Browser Controls:** Standard browser controls are visible on the left side—the back, forward, and refresh buttons. There's also a button that looks like a settings menu (with three dots).

* **Pretty-Print Toggle:** Above the JSON data, a checkbox labeled "Pretty-print" is checked (selected), indicating that the JSON is formatted for readability.

* **JSON Data:** The main part of the image shows the JSON response itself.  It's a simple object with a single key-value pair:
    * `"marks": [65, 74]` This indicates that a student has received scores of 65 and 74 in some subject(s).


The overall context suggests that this is a developer's view of a data fetch from a server-side API. The URL and the response format strongly suggest it's data related to student marks retrieved from a backend server using an API call.

@23f2003751  
While I understand why you might choose to use `flask` due to your familiarity with it,  
the `http.server` library is just very simple to use.

The **only extra line of code** you would need inside your `get` request if you used the `http.server` library would be:

`self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")`

Try to rewrite your code using `http.server` library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.

The boilerplate code for a `get` request using the `http.server` library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.

Kind regards

@23F300327 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.

GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.

Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.

Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.

There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser window. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Browser Tab:** The tab bar at the top displays several open tabs, including "Project 1," "TDS 2025," "GA2 - Depi," "how to install," "(no subject)," "ChatGPT," and three instances of "vercel-fast." This suggests the user is working on a project, possibly involving a fastAPI backend deployed on Vercel.

* **URL Bar:** The address bar displays a URL pointing to a Vercel application: `https://vercel-fastapi-aa0kdktjz-mishkat02s-projects.vercel.app/api?name=IE&name=G6k`.  The URL suggests an API endpoint is being accessed.

* **Console Output:** The majority of the window shows a dark background, characteristic of a developer console. A small snippet of code output is visible at the top of the console: `Pretty print ("marks": [58,531])`. This indicates the console is displaying a JSON-like response, possibly containing data related to markers or coordinates with values 58 and 531. The rest of the console is blank, implying it might be waiting for further input or processing.

* **Browser Controls:** Standard browser controls like the back button, forward button, refresh button, and address bar are visible. Bookmark and download icons are also visible.


In summary, the image depicts a developer working on a project involving a Vercel application and interacting with its API. The console output indicates the retrieval of some data, and the multiple tabs suggest a multi-faceted approach to development or testing.

@23F300327

Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.

When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api  
with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.

The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.

That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this

```
# api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return

```

Notice there is no `if __name__ == "__main__":` code block.  
This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.

`if __name__ == "__main__":` is used to execute some code **only** if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.

Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default `handler` class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.

Another possible problem:  
By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode

So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.

Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

Kind regards

even though its their

i don’t know why i am facing this issue anyone please check my git

* GitHub - NAMAN-BERI/actions
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a code snippet from a workflow or build process.  The most prominent feature is a text input field prompting the user to enter a repository URL.  

Specifically:

* **Prompt:** The text "What is your repository URL? It will look like: https://github.com/USER/REPO" clearly indicates the required input.  It provides an example format for the URL, showing the expected structure of `https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>`.

* **Input Field:** A text box below the prompt contains the URL "https://github.com/NAMAN-BERI/actions.git", which the user has presumably entered.

* **Error Message:** Below the input field, an error message is displayed: "Error: No runs found". This suggests the provided repository URL either doesn't contain any build runs, or there's an issue accessing them.


In summary, the image captures a moment during a process where the system is looking for build information from a specified GitHub repository but has failed to find any runs.  The error message directly indicates the failure and why the process has stopped.

how to create a iitm account in github…i am not getting the username  
please guide  
its proceeding like this …for my user name  

image594×296 15.8 KB
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a signup or login form with fields for password and username. 


**Password Field:**

* A text input field labeled "Password" with an asterisk indicating it's a required field.  
* The field shows a series of dots ("...") indicating that a password has been entered but is masked for security.
* Below the field, there's a message stating the password requirements: "Password should be at least 15 characters OR at least 8 characters including a number and a lowercase letter."


**Username Field:**

* A text input field labeled "Username" also with a required asterisk.
* The field currently contains the text "navya".
* Below the field, there's an error message in red text with an exclamation point icon: "Username navya is not available."
* Below the error message is a suggestion: "navya-stack, navya-cmyk, or navya856 are available."


**Overall:**

The form is likely part of a website or application's registration process. The user has attempted to use the username "navya," but it's already taken, and alternative suggestions are provided.  The password field requires a strong password meeting either length or complexity requirements. The styling suggests a modern, possibly web-based application.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web page displaying an error message. The error message is primarily composed of HTML code, indicating a server-side error.  Let's break down the key elements:

**Top Section:**

* **Instructions:** The top section gives instructions about downloading a file ("Llamafile"), running a specific model, and creating a tunnel using "ngrok."  A ngrok URL example is provided, suggesting a local development server.  The actual ngrok URL used is also displayed: `https://58e1-150-107-42-211.ngrok-free.app`

**Main Section:**

* **Error Message:** The bulk of the image shows a large block of HTML source code. This is the error response from a web server, not formatted as JSON as expected.  The HTML indicates a Cloudflare error (code 1101), which suggests a problem on the server side rather than the user's end. Specific error messages are shown within the HTML. The key phrases are:  "Worker threw exception," "An unknown error occurred while rendering the page," and various instructions for website owners to check Cloudflare error logs.  The error is specifically tied to the website `exam.sanand.workers.dev`.

**Technical Details within the HTML:**

* The HTML includes numerous class and ID attributes, suggesting it's a dynamically generated error page.  The classes often begin with `cf-`, indicating a Cloudflare-specific structure.  The HTML is also designed to be responsive to different browsers and screen sizes.
* A Ray ID is visible (9058ac347bd6dc94), a unique identifier for the error event helpful for debugging by Cloudflare support.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Cloudflare Footer:** The bottom part of the error message shows the standard Cloudflare error page footer with details about the Ray ID, IP address (hidden by default, but can be revealed by clicking a button), and a link back to Cloudflare.


In summary, the image depicts a detailed Cloudflare error message presented as raw HTML. The error likely originated from a server-side issue on `exam.sanand.workers.dev`, preventing a proper JSON response.  The top part of the image shows steps related to local development and server connection using ngrok.

Hi Mishkat,

I think url that you are submitting is wrong one. In below image there are two url’s under Domains those would be correct url’s to be submitted.  
For example `https://tds21jan.vercel.app/`.

The image shows a dark-themed Vercel deployment dashboard.  The dashboard displays information about a specific deployment.

**Key Information:**

* **Deployment:**  The main deployment name is `tds21jan-ghtj3xr7w-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`. This indicates a Vercel project deployment.

* **Domains:** Two domains are listed: `tds21jan.vercel.app` and `tds21jan-jivraj-18s-projects.vercel.app`.  The `vercel.app` suffix signifies a Vercel-hosted site.

* **Status:** The deployment status is shown as "Ready", indicating the application is successfully deployed and accessible.  The timestamp indicates it was deployed 18 hours ago by a user named `jivraj-18`.

* **Source:** The source code is accessible via a "View code" link, and the deployment was made via the `vercel deploy` command.

* **Application Screenshot:**  To the left is a screenshot of the deployed application.  It displays a simple "404 Not Found" error page, which means the deployed application is not yet configured to serve content correctly, despite having a "Ready" status.

* **Call to Action:** At the bottom, a message prompts the user to connect a Git repository to create a production deployment.  A "Connect Git repository" button is provided.

In summary, the image depicts a Vercel deployment that's technically "ready" (according to Vercel's infrastructure), but the application itself returns a 404 error, suggesting either missing routing, incorrect configuration, or an issue within the application code. The error and the prompt to connect a Git repository implies that the application might still be under development.

I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a `vercel.json` configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.

You can follow Gui Bibeau’s guide to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.

For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community. I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

The image shows a screenshot of a web page, seemingly an online quiz or learning platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

**Top Section:**

* **Header:** Shows a timer ("11:59 pm IST"), a score ("53/90"), and buttons for "Check" and "Save".  This suggests a timed quiz with a scoring system.
* **Instructions:**  A numbered list of instructions outlines how to use the platform. Key points include: checking answers regularly, saving progress frequently, the permissibility of using external resources (internet, friends, etc.), and even acknowledging the possibility of "hacking" the code to find answers.
* **Discourse Link:** A button invites users to join a discussion forum on Discourse for questions.
* **Login Information:** Displays the user's login information, indicating they're logged in with an academic email address.

**Middle Section:**

* **Recent Saves:** Shows a log of the user's recent saved attempts, including timestamps and scores.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Console/Code:** A large section shows a code snippet, possibly from a browser's developer console or a similar debugging tool. This supports the instruction that the quiz is "hackable". The language appears to be JavaScript. There's also mention of "Lllama 2" suggesting that a large language model is used in the quiz.

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be from an interactive online learning environment that encourages experimentation and the use of various resources, even hinting at the possibility of bypassing the intended methods of answering questions. The inclusion of a large code snippet strongly suggests the possibility of using programming skills to find solutions.

From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running.

For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit

which means server is working properly then i dont know whats the issue
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed code editor or terminal window displaying instructions and error messages.  The text is broken into sections:

1. **Instructions:** The top section gives instructions to download a file named "Llamafile," run a specific model ("Llama-3.2-18-Instruct.06 K.llamafile"), and then create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using "ngrok".  "Llamafile" and "ngrok" appear as hyperlinks (underlined).

2. **Expected Output:** The next section asks for the ngrok URL, providing an example format:  `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`.  The bracketed "[random]" indicates a randomly generated part of the URL.

3. **User Input:** A text input field below shows a long alphanumeric URL that follows the expected format, suggesting it's the user's ngrok URL: `https://4d63-2409-40d0-100e-46d9-419e-d652-5b0e-f8fe.ngrok-free.app/`.  There is a small, red circle with a white "i" in it to the right of this field, possibly indicating information or an error.

4. **Error Message:** The last line displays an error message:  "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524". This suggests a problem with a server response, likely indicating that the application failed to receive properly formatted JSON data, resulting in the error code 524.


The overall context suggests a user is attempting to set up a local server using ngrok to access and use the Llamafile model, but is encountering an error. The error code 524 typically points to a network time-out or a problem on the server the application is trying to connect to.

Here's a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a Chrome browser window on a macOS system.  The window displays an online coding exercise or quiz. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Browser Bar:** Shows the standard Chrome menu bar (File, Edit, View, etc.), browser address bar with a URL containing `exam.sanand.workers.dev`, and other browser controls (bookmarks, extensions).  The date and time in the top right corner show "Thu 23 Jan 4:12PM".

* **Quiz/Exercise Interface:** The main part of the screen shows a web page with a quiz-like structure.  The top of this section shows the due date and time ("Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"), a score ("Score: 5.5 / 10"), and buttons labeled "Check" and "Save".

* **Instructions and Input Fields:** The instructions ask the user to:
    1. Download `Llamafile`.
    2. Run a specific `Llama` model.
    3. Create a tunnel to the `Llamafile` server using `ngrok`.
    4. Input the resulting `ngrok` URL (a suggestion is provided in the format `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`).  A field is present where the user should enter their ngrok URL, and it currently contains `https://b1ae-117-198-90-156.ngrok-free.app`.

* **Error Message:** Below the input field, there's a prominent error message indicating that the response is not valid JSON and showing an HTML error response.  The core of the error is "501 - Server does not support this operation." This suggests the server doesn't support the method used (likely POST).

* **Dock:** The macOS dock is visible at the bottom of the screenshot showing various application icons.

In short, the screenshot captures a user encountering an error while completing a coding assignment or test involving the `Llamafile` model and the `ngrok` tunneling tool. The error points towards an incompatibility between the requested HTTP method (likely POST) and the server's capabilities.

I tried using github codespace for ngrok and cmd for llamafile, but im still encountering the same error no matter which port i use @Jivraj
The image shows a ngrok error page. The top shows the ngrok URL `1577-13-71-3-97.ngrok-free.app`. Below that is a diagram of the ngrok connection process, showing the path from the internet to the ngrok edge, agent, and finally the user's service. The connection to the user's service is indicated by an 'X', showing that the connection failed.

The main part of the page displays an error message: `ERR_NGROK_8012`. The message explains that traffic was successfully tunneled to the ngrok agent, but the agent failed to establish a connection to the upstream web service at `undefined://localhost:52525`. The error encountered was a connection refused error.  The specific error is further detailed as `dial tcp [::1]:52525: connect: connection refused`.  There is a button labelled "Get help with this error".

Below the error message, the page offers troubleshooting advice, separated into sections for developers and visitors:

* **For developers:** It instructs them to ensure a web service is running on `undefined://localhost:52525` on the machine where the ngrok agent is running.  They should try cURL or opening the address in a browser to check.  A link to documentation is provided.

* **For visitors:** It suggests waiting a few minutes and refreshing the page. If the problem persists, it advises contacting the page's developer.

Hi Naman,

error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search Error 524: A Timeout Occurred (What It Is & How to Fix It). I tried submitting now while replying at 2:45 am it was working fine.

@s.anand Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.

Hi Srividhya,

This error is because you are trying to access a feature of ngrok which requires to pay ERR\_NGROK\_501 | ngrok documentation.

I think you didn’t use authtoken to authenticate through your laptop. Follow second step on this page Quickstart | ngrok documentation to authenticate.

Hi Irina,

This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine.

Here is reference of error ERR\_NGROK\_8012 | ngrok documentation

@carlton can you clarify where went wrong
Here's a description of the image content:

The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a section of code or documentation related to an API (Application Programming Interface) endpoint and its testing.

**Key Text Elements:**

* **API Endpoint:** The prominent text `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` is highlighted, indicating the base URL of the FastAPI.
* **API Functionality Description:**  A paragraph explains that the API should accept a query parameter `class` (e.g., `/api?class=1A&class=1B`). Based on this parameter, it should return a JSON array of student records, only those students belonging to the specified classes.  The order of the students in the response should match the order in the source CSV file. The specification emphasizes that CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) must be enabled.
* **Error Message:** A large block of text shows an error message. This message indicates that the response from the API (`undefined`) does not match the expected JSON response (a list of student objects with `studentid` and `class` properties). The expected response is displayed immediately below the error.
* **Testing Procedure:** The last sentence mentions that a request will be sent to the API URL with the `class` parameter added to verify the API's functionality.
* **Task Instructions:** The overall goal is to identify the correct API endpoint URL and ensure it functions correctly according to specifications.


**Other Visual Elements:**

* **Taskbar:**  A Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom, showing icons for common applications. The time and date are also present (06:54, 24-01-2025).
* **Text Editor/IDE:** The displayed text is likely from a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) commonly used for coding or documentation.  The style suggests a code example or testing framework.


**In summary:** The screenshot depicts a debugging/testing phase of API development.  The developer is examining an error where the API's response doesn't match the expected outcome and outlining the next steps in troubleshooting.  The primary information of interest is the API endpoint URL and the expected JSON structure of its response based on input parameters.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying a JSON response. 


**Key Elements:**

* **Browser Address Bar:** The address bar shows a URL related to an API call: `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=6X&class=57&class=78&class=2Z`. This indicates a request to a local server (`127.0.0.1`) on port 8000, filtering data based on different class values.

* **JSON Data:** The main part of the screenshot displays a JSON array. Each element in the array is a dictionary containing `studentId` and `class` key-value pairs representing student information and their respective classes.

* **"Pretty-print" Checkbox:** A checkbox labeled "Pretty-print" is visible in the top-left corner, suggesting that the JSON was formatted for readability.

* **Browser Taskbar:** The bottom of the screenshot shows a Windows taskbar with various application icons. The time and date are displayed in the bottom-right corner: 06:55, 24-01-2005.

**In Summary:**

The image depicts a typical scenario of retrieving and displaying data from an API. The data itself is student information organized by student ID and class.  The URL structure suggests the API has filtering capabilities based on the class attribute.  The `Pretty-print` option confirms that the output is formatted for user readability.

Can any one help me to fix the following error in respect to answer to question 10  

image1326×349 8.53 KB
The image shows a screen capture of a web interface, likely part of a tutorial or guide. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Instructions:** The top section provides instructions. It asks the user to download a file named "Llamafile," run a specific model, and create a tunnel to a server using the service "ngrok."

* **ngrok URL Input:** There's an input field where the user is supposed to enter the URL generated by ngrok. A sample URL format is shown (`https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`). The user has entered `https://6eb1-27-7-78-14.ngrok-free.`  The input field has a small red exclamation mark icon indicating an error.

* **Error Message:** Below the input field, an error message is displayed: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 1016". This suggests there's a problem with the data being sent or received by the application.

* **Buttons:** At the bottom, there are two buttons: "Check" (green) and "Save" (blue). These buttons are likely used to verify the ngrok URL and save the input, respectively.

In short, the image depicts a step in a process where the user is having trouble providing a valid ngrok URL, resulting in a JSON error.

can anyone please explain what’s the error and how to correct it ?
The image shows a tutorial or exercise on using GitHub Actions.  Let's break down the content:

**Top Section:**  This section provides links to related help articles:

* **How to handle secrets in GitHub Actions:** This suggests a prior tutorial on secure handling of sensitive information within GitHub Actions.
* **How to run Github Actions on a Schedule:**  This points to guidance on automating actions based on a schedule (e.g., daily, weekly).

**Central Section:** This section guides the user on creating a GitHub Action:

* **Instruction:** Create a GitHub action within a repository. A crucial step is to name one step within the action using the user's email address (23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in).  This likely relates to a verification or identification process.
* **Example Code:**  A code snippet demonstrates the structure of a GitHub Actions workflow file (YAML format). It shows a job named "test," containing a step with the specified name containing the email and a simple `echo` command.
* **Triggering the Action:**  Instructions to trigger the created action and ensure it is the most recent execution.

**Bottom Section:** This section focuses on user input and error reporting:

* **Repository URL Input Field:**  A text field prompts the user to enter their repository URL in the format `https://github.com/USER/REPO`. The user has entered `https://github.com/divya23f3001255/divya.github.io`.
* **Error Message:** An error message appears: "Error: No step matches 23f3001255@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This indicates that the GitHub Action workflow didn't find a step with the specified email address in its name, which is a required part of the exercise.  The `①` symbol likely denotes an info icon indicating a problem.

**Overall:**

The image depicts a debugging step within a GitHub Actions tutorial. The user has likely made a mistake in configuring their workflow file. The error message explicitly tells the user that their workflow YAML file is not structured correctly and lacks the required email step name.  The user needs to correct their YAML file to fix the problem.

The image shows a screenshot of a webpage, likely an online quiz or test. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

**Top Section:**

* **Header:** Shows "11:59 pm IST Score: 53/90 Check Save" indicating the time, score, and options to check answers and save progress.

* **Instructions:** A numbered list of instructions for taking the quiz. Key points include: reading material is provided but optional, checking and saving answers regularly, browser-related issues and solutions, and the allowance of using any resources (even hacking the code).

* **Discourse Link:** A button invites users with questions to join a discussion on Discourse.

* **Login Information:** Displays the user's login information, indicating they are logged in as "231001348@study.iiit.ac.in".

* **Recent Saves:** A section displaying the user's recent saved attempts with timestamps and scores.

**Bottom Section:**

This section appears to show a developer console or code editor window.  It displays:

* **Instructions for interacting with a LLaMa model:** Instructions on how to download something ("Download: Run the LLaMa v2 7B decimal-LLaMa-2-7b-chat model with it."), create a named URL, and interact with it.  The code or URL it suggests is partially visible.
* **Console Output:** A large block of text resembling a Javascript code snippet or a program's output in the console. This likely shows interactions, errors, or responses related to the program’s use of the Llama model.

The overall context suggests a quiz or coding challenge that allows using external resources, including potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the quiz's code to obtain answers. The bottom section indicates using a large language model (LLaMa) to potentially assist in answering the questions.

@Jivraj Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:

1. Open Squoosh and load the image
2. In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).
3. The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes

image398×570 17.5 KB

I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.

image384×707 21.6 KB
The image shows a screenshot of a user interface (UI) for an image compression tool. 


Here's a breakdown of the UI elements:

* **Top Bar:** A light blue bar at the top displays "Edit" in white text, along with three icons: a left arrow (likely "back"), a right arrow (likely "forward"), and two gear icons (likely settings).

* **Options:** Below the top bar are several options presented in a clean, dark-themed interface.  Each option has a toggle switch (on/off) or a dropdown menu:
    * **Resize:** A toggle switch, likely to enable or disable resizing functionality.
    * **Reduce palette:** A toggle switch, probably for reducing the number of colors in the image.
    * **Compress:** A section dedicated to compression options.
        * **OxiPNG:** A dropdown menu to select the compression algorithm. OxiPNG is selected in the image.
        * **Interlace:** A checkbox.  Interlacing is a technique to progressively display images as they download.
        * **Effort:** A slider control with a number "2" at the far right end, indicating a setting for compression level. Higher effort means more compression but potentially more processing time.

* **Compression Results:** At the bottom, there is a light-blue box showing the compression results:
    * **↓63%:** Indicates a 63% reduction in file size.
    * **1.41 kB:** Shows the final size of the compressed image.

* **Download Button:** A bright blue, rounded download button with a downward-pointing arrow icon is prominent near the bottom right, suggesting an action to download the optimized image.

The overall design is clean and minimalist, typical of a modern software application. The dark theme with bright blue accents makes the UI elements easy to read and distinguish.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a user interface (UI) screenshot, likely from an image editing or compression tool. The UI is dark-themed with light blue accents.  Several options are presented to the user, organized in a vertical list.

**Top Bar:** The top bar contains the title "Edit," followed by navigation icons (likely back and forward buttons), and settings icons.

**Options:** Below, the following options are presented with toggles or dropdowns:

* **Resize:** A toggle switch to enable or disable resizing.
* **Reduce palette:** A toggle switch to enable or disable palette reduction.
* **Compress:** This section is a light blue header for compression settings.
* **WebP:** A dropdown menu, presumably for selecting the output format (WebP is selected).
* **Lossless:** A checkbox; currently checked, indicating lossless compression is enabled.
* **Effort:** A slider with a value of 9, likely controlling compression effort.
* **Slight loss:** A slider with a value of 0, seemingly to introduce a slight amount of lossy compression.
* **Discrete tone image:** A checkbox, currently unchecked.
* **Preserve transparent data:** A checkbox, currently unchecked.

**Bottom Bar:** At the bottom, a light blue banner displays the compression results: "↓83 %" (showing 83% reduction) and "630 B" (indicating the size of 630 bytes after compression).  A blue circle with a download arrow icon suggests a "Download" button.


The overall impression is a simple yet effective UI for image compression settings. The interface is straightforward and provides clear control over various compression parameters.

Contineously showing this sir. Even the server is running on background  

Screenshot 2025-01-25 1917361362×345 11.5 KB
The image shows a dark-themed interface, possibly a code editor or a web application for running and managing a Llamafile model. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Instructions:** The top section provides instructions: Download the `Llamafile`, run a specific model, and create a tunnel to the server using `ngrok`.

* **ngrok URL Input:** A text input field is present,  pre-filled with a URL: `https://328e-43-251-171-164.ngrok-free.app/`.  A small red exclamation mark icon indicates an error.

* **Error Message:** Below the input field, an error message is displayed: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524". This suggests a problem with the server's response, possibly due to an incorrect format or a server-side issue (HTTP status code 524 typically indicates a timeout or a connection problem with the origin server).

* **Example ngrok URL:** The instructions include an example of what the `ngrok` URL should look like, highlighting that a random part will be generated.

* **Buttons:** At the bottom, there are two buttons: "Check" and "Save."  These likely allow the user to validate the entered `ngrok` URL and save the information, respectively.


The overall context suggests that the user is attempting to set up a local Llamafile server and is facing a problem receiving a valid response from the server through the `ngrok` tunnel. The error message points towards a server-side issue that needs to be resolved.

for the fast api question, would there be an issue if i am using code spaces my url would look like  
https://symmetrical-space-cod-wrrjw5rw6xv7hvj9p-8000.app.github.dev/api  
@carlton @s.anand @Jivraj

Error is  
TypeError: Failed to fetch

Screenshot 2025-01-26 1842041661×452 47.1 KB

I’m leaving the url running, you can see you get a dummy response(clicking the link), how should i go about it. I’d prefer to use codespaces. Please help me

No problems, I got it , SOLUTION just made the port public
The image shows a code-based question and answer interface, likely from a programming tutorial or testing environment. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Instructions:** The top section provides instructions on how a FastAPI endpoint should behave. It explains that if the URL has a query parameter `class`, the API should return only students belonging to the specified classes. Multiple classes can be specified using `&`. The order of students in the response should match the order in the CSV data source. It also emphasizes the need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

* **API URL:** The next section asks for the API URL endpoint for FastAPI and suggests a possible format: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. A partially obscured input field is shown where a user likely needs to enter their specific API endpoint.

* **Error Message:** An error message, "TypeError: Failed to fetch," is prominently displayed, indicating a problem with fetching data from the specified API URL.

* **Testing Instruction:** The bottom section explains that the system will test the API by sending a request with the `?class=...` query parameter appended and will verify whether the response matches the expected data.


**Key elements for answering questions:**

* The obscured input field for the API URL is crucial; the correct API endpoint is needed for the system to function properly.  The error message suggests the provided (or automatically generated) URL is incorrect.
* The instructions clearly define the expected behavior of the API based on the `class` query parameter.  This is vital for designing the API correctly and verifying its functionality.


In short, the image captures a moment where a user is likely debugging or testing their FastAPI implementation, encountering a "Failed to fetch" error, and needing to provide the correct API endpoint.

for the tunneling, i am currently unable to do it has the ports are mismatched, I’m still working on the issue, but using codespaces and public ports i’ve achieved similar results and the question is marked right. Is this wrong/unethical. I will try to tunnel using ngrok though  

Screenshot 2025-01-26 204950897×267 20.4 KB
The image shows a screenshot of a code or command-line interface. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Instructions:** The top section provides instructions: Download a file named "Llamafile," run a specific model ("Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile"), and create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using "ngrok."

* **ngrok URL Prompt:** The next section asks for the ngrok URL, providing an example format: `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`.  The `[random]` part indicates a randomly generated portion of the URL.

* **User Input (Obscured):** A large blacked-out rectangular area is below the prompt. This area likely represents the user's input of their actual ngrok URL. It is intentionally censored.

* **Correct Feedback:** At the very bottom, the word "Correct" appears, suggesting the user's obscured input was validated as correct.

In essence, the image captures a step-by-step process involving a large language model ("Llama") and a tunneling service ("ngrok"). The user successfully generated and provided a ngrok URL, indicated by the "Correct" message.

@23f1002382

Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.

Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!

So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

In the meanwhile:

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

Kind regards
Here's a description of the image:

The image is a vibrant, animated graphic explaining network ports. 


**Key Elements:**

* **Title:** The words "PORTS EXPLAINED ANIMATED" are prominently displayed in large, stylized, green text against a dark background.  "EXPLAINED" is in a brighter, bolder green.

* **Port Table:** A central table lists common network port numbers and their corresponding services (e.g., FTP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP, etc.).  The table is well-organized, with columns for "DESCRIPTION" and "PORT NUMBER,"  and has a dark green background with light green text.

* **Server Representation:** A stylized graphic of a server rack is displayed on the right side. It shows various indicators like IP addresses, LAN status, fan speed (RPM), temperature, and storage utilization.  The design is futuristic and suggestive of a high-performance computing system.  The server also displays the word "SERVER" in green.

* **Computer Graphic:** A simple graphic of a desktop computer with a green screen is shown on the left.  This visual represents a client connecting to the server.

* **Background:** The overall background blends dark green and blue shades, creating a visually appealing effect that emphasizes the technical theme.

**Overall Impression:**

The image effectively conveys information about network ports using a combination of text, graphics, and color to create a visually engaging and memorable learning experience.  The animated aspect (implied by the title) suggests movement or visual interaction within the graphic. The style is clean, professional, and geared towards an audience interested in computer networking concepts.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image is a digital illustration explaining the concept of a firewall. 


Here's a breakdown of the elements:

* **Title:** At the top, in large, bold white letters, is the title "FIREWALL EXPLAINED".

* **Firewall Representation:** A large, red brick wall, labeled "FIREWALL" vertically along its side, is the central focus. It visually represents the firewall blocking threats.

* **Hacker Representation:** On the left, a stylized black figure resembling a hacker wearing a hat is depicted, labeled "HACKER". A laptop screen is partially visible behind the hacker's figure, showing lines of code.

* **Threats:** Three red skull and crossbones symbols are shown approaching the firewall from the left. These represent malware or other cyber threats trying to breach the system.

* **Background:** The background is a split gradient of blue and green, providing a visually appealing contrast to the red firewall.

* **Overall style:** The style is cartoonish and simplified, aiming for easy understanding rather than technical realism.  The colors are bright and attention-grabbing.

The image successfully conveys the core idea of a firewall: protecting a computer system (represented by the laptop) from malicious external threats (the skulls). The simplicity of the design makes the concept easy to grasp.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image is a stylized comparison of Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers in a visually appealing, almost futuristic manner.

**Left Side (VMs):**

* Three identical server racks are depicted, each showing internal components and applications running as virtual machines. The labels "EMAIL," "WEBSERVER," "DATABASE," and "VIRTUAL MACHINES" clearly identify the contents.  The servers have a dark, techy green aesthetic.

* A modern desktop computer with a blue screen is positioned in front of the servers. The computer screen shows the word "CONTAINERS" in large, white, bold font.


**Right Side (Containers):**

* A large, black server rack, labeled "POWERCERT," is shown.  Its front panel has numerous colorful lights, suggesting activity.

* The server rack displays multiple applications running within containers, each labeled "APPLICATION." These applications are shown in green on dark panels.  At the bottom of the rack, the text "CONTAINERS" appears.

**Center:**

* The words "VMs vs CONTAINERS" are prominently displayed in large, bold, white letters.  "vs" is written smaller and is in between the two terms.

* At the bottom, the word "ANIMATED" suggests the image is part of an animated explanation or video.

**Overall:**

The visual style uses a dark background with bright, contrasting colors to make the information stand out.  The server racks and their visual content (metrics, data representations) all communicate a tech-focused message. The contrast between the VM setup (more individually encapsulated) and the container setup (more integrated, shared-resource based) is clear. The visual layout is well-organized and effectively presents the core concepts of VM versus container technologies.

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.

Can you clarify why this is happening?

because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.

The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.

Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”

Kind regards

hi @23f2003853

I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of `127.0.0.1`. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Hello Sir,

I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.

Thanks and Regards

The image shows a code snippet from a debugging session. 


Here's a breakdown:

* **Instruction:** The top line instructs the user to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to permit GET requests from any origin. This is a common issue in web development when a client-side application (e.g., a website) tries to access resources from a different domain than the one it's hosted on.

* **Vercel URL prompt:**  The next section asks for the Vercel URL. Vercel is a platform for deploying serverless functions and web applications. It provides a `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`-like structure for URLs.  The user has entered `https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api` as their Vercel URL.

* **Error Message:** The final line displays an error message: "Error: Expected [73,73,53,63,61] but got [73,53,61,63,73]".  This suggests a mismatch between an expected array of numbers (likely representing some sort of data, possibly RGB color codes) and the actual array received. The discrepancy indicates a problem in the application's logic or data handling.


In summary, the image depicts a troubleshooting scenario where the user needs to fix a CORS issue and a data-related error.  The error is likely not directly related to the Vercel URL itself, but may be caused by a problem in the application's backend or its interaction with the Vercel environment.

Hi Shalini,

I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.

Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel, just check your code if it’s logically correct.

Kind regards

image871×900 40.7 KB

  
Here is my code. Could you please help me identify any issues or clarify where I might be going wrong?
The image contains a Python code snippet implementing a simple HTTP handler.  Let's break down the code section by section:

**1. Imports:**

The code starts by importing necessary modules:

* `json`: For handling JSON data.
* `os`: For interacting with the operating system (e.g., finding file paths).
* `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`: From the `http.server` module, it's the base class for handling HTTP requests.
* `parse_qs`, `urlparse`: From `urllib.parse`, these are used to parse query parameters from URLs.


**2. Handler Class:**

A class `handler` inherits from `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`. This class defines how the server responds to HTTP requests.

**3. `do_GET` Method:**

This method handles GET requests. It does the following:

* **CORS Headers:** Sets Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to allow requests from any origin. This is crucial for enabling requests from different domains (e.g., a front-end web application communicating with a back-end API server).

* **JSON Data Loading:** Loads JSON data from a file (`../q-vercel-python.json`) located relative to the script's directory.

* **Query Parameter Parsing:** Parses the query parameters from the URL, specifically looking for a parameter named `name`.

* **Error Handling:** If the `name` parameter is missing, it returns a JSON error response.

* **Marks Collection:** If the `name` parameter is present, it searches the loaded JSON data for entries matching the given names and collects their corresponding `marks`.

* **Response:** If marks are found, it returns them in a JSON response; otherwise, it returns a "Name not found" error.


**4. `do_OPTIONS` Method:**

This method handles OPTIONS requests, typically used in preflight CORS requests. It sets the necessary CORS headers to allow the browser to make the actual GET request.

**In Summary:**

The Python code defines an HTTP handler that serves JSON data based on a `name` query parameter. It includes robust CORS handling and error checking.  The JSON data is loaded from a file relative to the script's location.  The code's primary function is to fetch specific data points (`marks`) based on provided names from the query parameters.

Till yesterday I was able to login ngrok. But today it shows some error  

image1366×768 69.7 KB

  
can anyone guide me to fix it
The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a ngrok device activation page.  The main focus is a modal window with an error message: "The information supplied for MFA verification was invalid." This suggests a problem with multi-factor authentication.

The user has entered a code ("4VZTALOCF43MBSGDR63ZL7THHK4B0613") in the input field on the ngrok device activation page.  Buttons for "Continue" and "Back to QR Code" are also visible.  Below the input field is an assurance that ngrok staff will never ask for a code on that page.  The bottom of the ngrok page says "Made with ♥ by ngrok".

The browser's address bar shows the URL `dashboard.ngrok.com/login/mfa/setup`, confirming the context of the error.  The taskbar at the bottom of the screen reveals various applications and the Windows operating system's activation notification.  The taskbar also displays time and date.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed text-based interface, possibly a chat window or code editor.  The text is primarily focused on instructions related to setting up and using a Llamafile server and the ngrok tunneling service.

Here's a breakdown of the text content:

* **Instructions:** The top section provides instructions: Download Llamafile, run a specific Llamafile model, and create a tunnel to the server using ngrok.

* **ngrok URL Example:** It then asks for the ngrok URL, providing an example of what the URL might look like.  The example uses placeholders like `[random]` to show a variable part of the URL.

* **Actual ngrok URL:**  Below that, a specific ngrok URL is shown. This is the likely output of the ngrok command, which provides a publicly accessible address for the local server.  This URL begins with `https://fd8c...ngrok-free.app/`

* **Highlighted Text:** Key words like "Llamafile," "ngrok," and parts of the URLs are highlighted in different colors, making them stand out against the dark background.

* **Interface Elements:**  The interface seems to be designed for code or instructions.  There's a clear distinction between the instructions and the resulting ngrok URL. There's a small circular icon with an "i" inside near the end of the bottom line, possibly indicating information or a warning.


In short, the image captures a step-by-step guide for setting up a Llamafile server, accessible through ngrok tunneling. The final ngrok URL is displayed as the successful result.

@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj  
Sir I am getting this “TypeError: Load failed” for Q9 inspite of getting proper responses in “http://127.0.0.1:8000/api”, cors is also enabled. Please help me with this, I am finding it difficult to circumvent this.  

Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 10.08.58 PM2618×366 47 KB

  

22234×188 34.4 KB
The image shows a screenshot of a code editor or testing environment. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Instructions:** The top section provides instructions, stating, "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."  This indicates a need for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to be enabled for the API to function correctly.

* **Question and Answer Field:** The next section poses a question: "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api". There's an input field where the user is supposed to provide the API URL. The user has entered  `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ap` (note the missing 'i' at the end of 'api'). A small red circle with an exclamation mark inside it is visible next to the input field, suggesting an error or warning.

* **Error Message:** Below the input field, a "TypeError: Load failed" message appears, confirming an error occurred during the loading or accessing of the specified API endpoint.

* **Testing Procedure:** The final part explains the next step in the process. It says, "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with ?class=... added and check if the response matches the data," indicating that a request will be made to the provided URL, with additional parameters, to verify the response.


In summary, the screenshot displays a problem encountered while interacting with an API. The user has input an incomplete or incorrect API URL, which resulted in a loading failure. The testing environment is about to attempt a verification request with added parameters to resolve the issue.
 The image shows a computer screen displaying a JSON object containing student data. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A dark-colored top bar contains several icons and text elements.  From left to right:

    * **Traffic Light Icons:** Three small colored circles (red, amber, green) suggesting a status indicator.
    * **Folder Icon:** A small icon resembling a folder.
    * **Down Arrow:** A small down arrow icon.
    * **Left Arrow:** A small left arrow icon.
    * **Google Logo:** A stylized Google "G" logo.
    * **File Size:** "1270.0.1" appears within a gray box, which may indicate a file size or server address.
    * **Filter Icon:** A small funnel-shaped icon suggesting a filter function.
    * **Tools Dropdown:** A dropdown menu labeled "Tools in Data Sc..." is partially visible.
    * **Date Dropdown:** Another dropdown labeled "TDS 2025 Jan G..." likely indicates a date or project.

* **JSON Data:** Below the top bar, the main content is a JSON object representing student data:

    ```json
    {"students":[{"studentId":34,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":453, "class":"1A"},{"studentId":551,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":829,"class":"1A"},{"studentId":1309, "class":"1A"},{"studentId":1795,"class":"1A"}]}
    ```
    This shows an array of student objects, each having a `studentId` and a `class` attribute.

The overall appearance suggests a web application or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used for data manipulation or analysis. The JSON data likely originates from or is being managed within this application.

After checking few times now i started getting below error please help  

image1348×352 21.4 KB
The image shows a snippet of a text-based interface, possibly from a web application or terminal. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Instructions:** The top section gives instructions: Download a file named "Llamafile," run a specific model with it, and create a tunnel to a server using a tool called "ngrok."

* **ngrok URL:**  It asks for the ngrok URL, providing an example of what it should look like (a randomly generated subdomain followed by ".ngrok-free.app"). 

* **Generated ngrok URL:** A text box displays a generated ngrok URL: `https://02f4-2402-e280-3e32-27f-4b0-6f91-4275-52f3.ngrok-free.app`. This is likely the output of the ngrok tool.

* **Error Message:** Below the ngrok URL is an error message: "Error: Response is not valid JSON: error code: 524". This indicates a problem with the response received from the server accessed through the ngrok tunnel; the response is not in the expected JSON format.

The key takeaway is that while a ngrok tunnel was successfully created, there's an issue with the server the tunnel connects to, leading to a JSON parsing error.  The `524` error code is a common HTTP error indicating a problem with the server's response (usually a timeout).

The image shows a coding challenge or assignment interface. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** Displays the date and time (Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST), a score (8/10), and buttons labeled "Check" and "Save".

* **Instructions:** The main part of the screen provides instructions to complete a task. These instructions involve:

    * **Downloading a JSON file:** The user is asked to download a file named `q-vercel-python.json`, containing marks of 100 imaginary students.
    * **Creating and Deploying an API:** The user needs to create a Python application and deploy it to Vercel. This application must expose an API that accepts GET requests with parameters `name=X&name=Y`.  The API should respond with a JSON object containing a list of marks corresponding to names X and Y. An example JSON response is provided: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.
    * **Enabling CORS:** The user must enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow GET requests from any origin.
    * **Vercel URL:** The user is asked to provide the Vercel URL of their deployed application.  The expected format is `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`.

* **User Input:** There's an input field where the user enters their Vercel URL. The user has entered `https://vercel-project-three-liard.vercel.app/api`.

* **Error Message:** An error message is displayed indicating that the expected output `[35,71,83,96,95]` does not match the actual output `[null,null,null,null,null]`. This suggests the user's API is not functioning correctly.

I have solved the question and when i enter the answer its showing me incorrect, sir could you please help me out. I am attaching the images of my code and the tds

image847×696 34.5 KB
This image shows a Google Colab coding exercise.  The goal is to determine the number of pixels in an image that have a lightness value greater than 0.219.

Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

* **Instructions:**  The top section gives instructions to download a specific image, create a new Google Colab notebook, and run the provided Python code after fixing a brightness issue.  A score (0.5 marks) is also indicated.

* **Code:** The core of the image is a Python code snippet that uses libraries like NumPy and Pillow (PIL) to process the image. The code performs the following steps:
    * Imports necessary libraries: NumPy, PIL's Image module, Google Colab's `files` module for file uploads, and the `colorsys` module for color conversions.
    * Uploads the image: `image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys())[0])` - This line has a potential error (the original error is in the image's description, which is why it is marked to be fixed).  It attempts to open the uploaded image. The correct syntax would involve indexing into the `files.upload()` dictionary directly, like so: `image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys())[0])`
    * Converts the image to a NumPy array: `rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0`  This normalizes pixel values to the range 0-1.
    * Calculates lightness: `lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)` This line uses a lambda function to apply the `colorsys.rgb_to_hls` function along the axis of the image, extracting the lightness component (the second element returned by `rgb_to_hls`).
    * Counts light pixels: `light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.219)` This sums up the number of pixels where the lightness value exceeds 0.219.
    * Prints the result: `print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: {light_pixels}')`

* **Answer and Feedback:**  Below the code, there's a text box where the user inputs their answer (a number representing the count of light pixels).  The image shows an incorrect answer (248985) and feedback indicating it's wrong.

* **Error Message:** The feedback section provides "Incorrect. Try again."


To solve this problem, a user would need to:

1. Download the image mentioned in the instructions.
2. Create a new Google Colab notebook.
3. Copy and paste the code.
4. Correct the image uploading line if necessary.
5. Run the code.
6. Enter the resulting number of pixels (the output of `print`) into the answer box.

The incorrect answer of 248985 suggests either a mistake in the code, a problem with the uploaded image, or an issue with the code's execution environment (Colab).  The problem likely stems from the image uploading part, a possible error in the `image = Image.open(...)` line.  If the rest of the code is correct, then the final printed output will be the correct answer.

image857×448 25.8 KB
The image shows a Jupyter Notebook code cell containing Python code that processes an image. Let's break down the code and the output:


**Code:**

1. **Imports:** The code starts by importing necessary libraries:
   - `numpy` (as `np`): For numerical operations, especially array manipulation.
   - `PIL.Image`: From the Pillow library, for image processing.
   - `google.colab.files`: Specific to Google Colab, for file uploads.
   - `colorsys`: For color space conversions (RGB to HLS in this case).

2. **File Upload:** `uploaded=files.upload()` prompts the user to upload a file (presumably an image) in a Google Colab environment.

3. **Image Loading:** `image = Image.open(list(uploaded.keys())[0])` opens the uploaded image using the PIL library.  It gets the first key (filename) from the `uploaded` dictionary.

4. **RGB to Array:** `rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0` converts the image into a NumPy array, normalizing the pixel values to the range 0-1 (by dividing by 255).

5. **Lightness Calculation:** This is the core of the image analysis:
   - `lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)`: This line is crucial. It iterates through each pixel (represented as an RGB tuple `x`). For each pixel, it converts the RGB values to HLS (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) using `colorsys.rgb_to_hls`.  It then extracts the lightness component (`[1]`). The `np.apply_along_axis` efficiently applies this function along the axis representing the pixels (axis 2).

6. **Counting Light Pixels:** `light_pixels = np.sum(lightness >= 0.219)` sums up the number of pixels where the lightness value is greater than or equal to 0.219 (a threshold).

7. **Output:** `print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: {light_pixels}')` prints the calculated number of pixels with high lightness.

**Output:**

Below the code cell, the output shows:

- **File Upload Confirmation:**  `lenna.webp (image/webp) - 14820 bytes, last modified: 1/30/2025 - 100% done` indicates that a file named `lenna.webp` was successfully uploaded (it's likely a standard test image).
- **Saving Confirmation:** `Saving lenna.webp to lenna (1).webp` shows that the image was saved locally within the Colab environment.
- **Result:** `Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985` is the final output of the code, indicating that 248,985 pixels in the `lenna.webp` image have a lightness value above the set threshold.


In essence, this code snippet demonstrates a simple image analysis task: determining the number of bright pixels in an image by measuring the lightness component of each pixel's color.  The use of NumPy allows for efficient vectorized operations, significantly faster than looping through individual pixels.

this is my code  

image857×448 25.8 KB
The image shows a Jupyter Notebook code cell containing Python code, along with its output.

**Code:**

The Python code uses the following libraries:

*   `numpy` (imported as `np`): For numerical operations, especially array manipulation.
*   `PIL` (Pillow): For image processing.
*   `google.colab`:  Specific to Google Colab environment, likely for file handling.
*   `colorsys`: For color space conversions.

The code performs the following actions:

1.  **Uploads a file:** `uploaded=files.upload()` suggests a file upload dialog in a Colab environment.
2.  **Opens the image:** `image = Image.open(list(uploaded.keys())[0])` opens the uploaded image using the PIL library.
3.  **Converts to NumPy array:** `rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0` converts the image to a NumPy array, normalizing pixel values to the range 0-1.
4.  **Calculates lightness:** `lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)` calculates the lightness component (from the HLS color space) for each pixel using the `colorsys.rgb_to_hls` function.
5.  **Counts light pixels:** `light_pixels = np.sum(lightness >= 0.219)` counts the number of pixels where the lightness value is greater than or equal to 0.219.
6.  **Prints the result:** `print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: {light_pixels}')` prints the count of light pixels to the console.

**Output:**

The output section shows:

*   The uploaded file name (`lenna.webp`) and its size (14820 bytes).
*   A message indicating successful saving of the file.
*   The result of the code:  The number of pixels with lightness greater than 0.219 (248985).

**Overall:**

The code analyzes an image (`lenna.webp`, a common test image) to determine the number of pixels with a lightness value exceeding a certain threshold. This is likely a simple image processing task demonstrating the use of NumPy and PIL for image manipulation and analysis in a Google Colab environment.

I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.

In Q9. I have created dictionary of given data. You can check the for format in the given codes just above the question.(see Test with curl api)

I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.  
Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

I have laready tried doing that as well but it still doesnt seem to work
The image shows a Jupyter Notebook code cell with Python code and its output.  The code processes an image (presumably named `lenna.webp`) to count the number of pixels with a lightness value above a threshold (0.219).

Here's a breakdown:

**Code:**

The code begins by importing necessary libraries: NumPy (`np`), the Python Imaging Library (`PIL`), Google Colab's `files` module (for file uploads), and the `colorsys` module for color space conversions.  It then uploads a file (`lenna.webp` in this case) using `files.upload()`.  The code opens the uploaded image using `PIL.Image.open()`, converts it to a NumPy array, normalizes the pixel values (dividing by 255), converts RGB values to HLS (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) using `colorsys.rgb_to_hls`, and finally calculates the number of pixels where the lightness value is greater than 0.219.  The result (the count of such pixels) is then printed to the console.

**Output:**

Below the code cell, the output shows:

* **File Upload:**  The output indicates that a file named `lenna.webp` (an image file) was uploaded successfully, specifying its size and last modified date.
* **Pixel Count:** The final line prints the number of pixels satisfying the lightness condition, which is 248985.

**Overall:**

The image depicts a complete data science workflow involving image processing within a Jupyter Notebook environment.  The code is concise, using NumPy for efficient array operations and demonstrating basic image analysis techniques. The output confirms the successful execution of the code and presents the result in a clear and readable manner.

We see things like "IIT Madras," "Graded Assign," "TDS 2025 Jar," and potentially references to deployment or a particular programming language (Python is visible).  There are also close buttons ('X').

* **URL Bar:** The URL bar contains a Vercel URL (`vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api?name="dzPtdczl9"`). This suggests that the response came from a serverless function or API deployed on the Vercel platform.  The `?name=` part indicates a parameter was passed to the API.

* **Main Window:** The main window displays a JSON response within a text editor or code viewer.  The response seems simple, containing a key `"marks"` with a single-element list `[65]` as its value.  The text "Pretty-print" is visible, suggesting a formatting option is used for the JSON.

* **Browser Controls:** Standard browser controls are present (back button, forward button, refresh button).

In summary, the image likely captures a student or developer fetching data—specifically a numerical score (65)—from an API.  The context points to an academic or project setting related to IIT Madras and a course or assignment involving TDS 2025.
 Here's a description of the image content:

The image shows a coding exercise or assignment interface, likely from an online learning platform or coding challenge website.  The instructions are clear and involve several steps:

1. **Download a JSON file:** The user is instructed to download a file named `q-vercel-python.json`, which contains data about the marks of 100 imaginary students.  A clickable button visually represents this download action.

2. **Create and Deploy a Python App:** The user needs to create a Python application and deploy it using Vercel, a platform for deploying serverless functions and web applications.

3. **Create an API Endpoint:** The application should expose an API endpoint (`/api`) that accepts GET requests with query parameters for names (e.g., `name=X&name=Y`).

4. **JSON Response:** Upon receiving a request, the API should return a JSON response containing the marks for the specified names. An example of the expected JSON response is shown: `{"marks": [10, 20]}`.

5. **Enable CORS:**  Crucially, the instructions emphasize the need to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow GET requests from any origin, preventing common security issues in web applications.

6. **Vercel URL Input:** There's a text input field where the user needs to enter the deployed application's Vercel URL. The expected format is shown as `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`. The correct URL is already partially filled in: `https://vercelapp-mvqtg2t29-sri-balajis-projects-ec088a33.vercel.app/api`.  However, below this field, there's an error message: "TypeError: Failed to fetch". This error indicates that the application, although seemingly correctly deployed to the given URL, is not functioning correctly.  The application likely isn't returning the expected JSON response.

7. **Overall:** The image shows a debugging step where the deployed application's URL is entered and verified, yet there's a clear error indicating that the backend fetch failed.  The user needs to troubleshoot their code to fix the issue and get the API response to function as required.

TDS GA2 Q9, I have passed the same class as of the error thrown test case for ease of reference. Both are same to same. Yet I’m getting error when i submit the answer. @carlton @Jivraj , Kindly please clarify what I’m doing wrong.  
#samesamebutdiffalant
The image contains a code snippet related to testing an API endpoint using FastAPI. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Question:** "What is the API URL endpoint for FastAPI? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api" This sets the context, asking for the API endpoint URL.

* **Answer/Input Field:** Below the question is a text input field displaying  `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. This is likely the user's provided or suggested API endpoint.  There is a small information icon to the right of the field.

* **Error Message:**  A large red error message follows, indicating a mismatch between the expected API response and the actual response received. The expected response is a JSON array of student IDs and their classes.  The error message shows this expected JSON data.

* **Next Step:**  The final line explains the next step in debugging: sending another API request with a query parameter (`?class...`) to further check the response against the expected data.


In essence, the image shows a debugging process where the user has specified an API endpoint and encountered an error. The error message points to an issue with the data returned by the API. The user intends to investigate further using additional query parameters in their API calls.
 The image shows a screenshot of a web browser window displaying a JSON response. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Address Bar:** The address bar at the top shows a URL: `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`. This indicates a request to a local API endpoint (`127.0.0.1:8000/api`) with filters for different classes (5N, 1T, 11P, 9W).

* **Pretty-printed JSON:** The main part of the window shows a JSON response that has been "pretty-printed" (formatted for readability).  This JSON contains an array of objects, where each object represents a student with a `studentId` and a `class`.  The values of `class` appear to be codes representing different student groups.

* **"Pretty-print" Label:** To the left of the JSON data, there's a label that suggests that the JSON data has been formatted for better readability.

* **Browser Controls:** Standard browser navigation buttons (back, forward, refresh) are visible in the top left corner.  There's also a home button.


In essence, the image shows the result of an API call that retrieves a list of students, filtered by their class, and presented in a user-friendly JSON format.  The response shows a series of student IDs and their associated class codes.

@23F3002987\_J\_SRI\_BAL ,

This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.

Solution :

Go to vercel dashboard and select your project, and below domains you would find a url use that.

The image shows a Vercel access error page. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Browser Address Bar:** The address bar at the top shows a Vercel URL with a long, encoded parameter string, suggesting a specific project or deployment.

* **Vercel Logo:** A small, stylized Vercel logo is visible in the upper left corner of the screen.

* **Error Message:** The main content is a clear error message indicating "Team Access Required."  The message specifies that the user "jivraj-18" is signed in but lacks the necessary team access to view the requested deployment.  It offers a solution: requesting access to the up-to-date deployment URL.

* **Call to Action:**  A button prompts the user to "Log in with a different Vercel Account."

* **Vercel Branding:** A small, circular gradient logo is positioned centrally above the error message. The overall design style maintains Vercel's brand aesthetic.

The error suggests that the user is trying to access a deployment that is restricted to a specific team or organization within Vercel. The user needs either to join that team or use a different Vercel account with the appropriate permissions.
 The image shows a Vercel dashboard displaying information about a deployed application. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Browser Address Bar:** The address bar shows the URL `https://vercel.com/jivraj-18s-projects/api`, indicating the project's location on Vercel.

* **Vercel Navigation Bar:** A standard Vercel navigation bar is visible at the top, with options for "Project," "Deployments," "Analytics," "Speed Insights," "Logs," "Observability," "Firewall," "Storage," and "Settings."

* **"Production Deployment" Header:** This header clearly indicates that the view shows the production deployment of the application.

* **"Not Found" Error:** A prominent "Not Found" error message is displayed in a white box, suggesting that the requested URL (likely the base URL of the application) did not return a valid response. The error message explains the server didn't find the requested URL.

* **Deployment Information:** On the right, detailed information about the deployment is given:
    * **Deployment Name:** `api-6xs8fp81c-jivraj-18s-projects.verceLapp`
    * **Domains:** `api-ruby-seven-48.verceLapp` (and it appears there is at least one more, indicated by "+2")
    * **Status:** Shows "Ready" in a green circle, indicating the application is deployed and functional, despite the "Not Found" error which is likely due to a configuration or routing issue.
    * **Created:** The deployment was created on January 28th by the user "jivraj-18".
    * **Source Code:** Links to the source code and provides a command (`_vercel deploy`) presumably for redeployment.

* **Logs:** Buttons for accessing "Build Logs" and "Runtime Logs" are present.

The discrepancy between the "Ready" status and the "Not Found" error suggests a potential problem with the application's configuration or routing.  The application might be deployed successfully, but it's not responding correctly to the requested URL.  The "Not Found" error is a client-side error, but the deployment details suggest the server-side is ready to go.

> I have laready tried doing that as well but it still doesnt seem to work

Hi @daksh76, Can you mention exact error or problem that you are facing.
That's an image of a simple icon or avatar. 


Here's a description:

* **Background:** The background is a solid, dark teal or hunter green color.

* **Letter:** A capital letter "D" is centered on the background.  The "D" is white or light-colored, with a sans-serif font.  The "D" appears to be a fairly standard, simple typeface.

* **Size and Shape:** The image is square, and the "D" occupies a significant portion of the square's area.  There's no other imagery or elements present.

The image is likely used as a placeholder, profile picture, or initial for a person or entity whose name begins with "D".

The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using `127.0.0.1` and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with `http://localhost:8000/api` to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the `ipconfig` command to check the correct IP address.

We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

@Jivraj , Thankyou for the quick response. I have attached both console and network screenshots. Hope these are the ones you were referring to. Sure, I will join tonight’s session and try to rectify the issue. Meanwhile will update here if i was able to resolve it.
The image shows a browser window displaying the Network tab of the developer tools.  The main focus is on the response from an API call.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Address Bar:** Shows the URL `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=11P&class=9W`, indicating a request to a local API with parameters specifying different classes.

* **Pretty-printed JSON Response:** The left pane displays a neatly formatted JSON response from the API. This JSON data is a list of objects, each representing a student with a `studentId` and a `class` attribute.  Many student IDs and classes are shown.

* **Network Tab:** The right pane shows the details of the network request.

    * **Timeline:**  A horizontal timeline visualizing the request's duration.  A green bar indicates the fetch time, and an orange bar indicates the response time.  The total time is displayed as approximately 20ms.

    * **Request Details:**  This section shows:
        * **Name:** The API endpoint URL.
        * **Status:** `200`, indicating a successful response.
        * **Type:** `document` specifying the response type.
        * **Initiator:** `Other`, suggesting the request was initiated programmatically rather than by a user action.
        * **Size:** `694 B`, the size of the response data.
        * **Time:** `12 ms`, the time taken for the request to complete.

    * **Summary:** Below the request details, a summary shows that 1 request was made, 694 bytes were transferred, and 568 bytes were received as resources. The load time is indicated as 28ms.  The `DOMContentLoaded` time is shown as 27ms.


* **Console:** The bottom-left corner shows the console area.

* **Issues Panel:** An issues panel at the bottom-right indicates a warning: "A form field element should have an id or name attribute." This is unrelated to the API request itself but represents a general warning from the browser's developer tools.

In short, the image depicts a successful API call returning a JSON list of student data, with timings and details of the network request clearly shown in the browser's developer tools.  The error message in the issues panel suggests a separate issue in the webpage's code.
 The image shows a browser window with a developer console open. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Browser Top Bar:** Standard browser elements like back/forward buttons, address bar showing a local development URL (`127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=5N&class=1T&class=119&class=9W`), and other browser controls.

* **Left Pane (Pretty-Printed JSON):** This section displays a JSON array neatly formatted.  Each object in the array represents a student with an `studentId` and a `class`. The classes seem to be abbreviated codes (e.g., "SN," "1T," "11P," "9W").

* **Right Pane (Developer Tools):** This shows the browser's developer tools, with tabs like "Elements," "Console," "Sources," "Network," "Performance," and "Memory."

* **Console Tab:**  Currently, the console is mostly empty, with the exception of a single warning or error message at the bottom: "A form field element should have an id or name attribute."  This suggests a validation issue within a form on the webpage.

* **Issues Tab:** This tab shows a summary of detected issues. There is one issue reported.

The overall context suggests a developer is inspecting a web application's API response (the JSON data in the left pane). The console message hints at a front-end validation problem that needs addressing, possibly relating to accessibility or form submission functionality.

The image shows a code editor or similar interface with instructions and a partially filled form. Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Instructions:**

The instructions guide the user to:

1. **Download a JSON file:**  `q-vercel-python.json` containing marks for 100 imaginary students.
2. **Create and deploy a Python app to Vercel:** This involves building a web application using Python and deploying it to the Vercel platform.
3. **Expose an API:** The app should have an API endpoint that accepts GET requests with parameters (`name-X` and `name-Y`) and returns a JSON response containing the corresponding marks.  An example request URL is given: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/name-X&name-Y`.
4. **Enable CORS:**  Crucially, the application must enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow GET requests from any origin. This is necessary to allow external websites or applications to access the API.
5. **Provide the Vercel URL:** The user must enter the URL of their deployed Vercel application.

**Example JSON Response:**

A snippet shows the expected format of the JSON response:

```json
{
  "marks": [10, 20]
}
```

**Input Field and Error:**

There's an input field where the user is supposed to enter their Vercel app URL.  A partially visible URL is present: `https://tdsproject1-Itjsdpii1-23f2003853-projects.vercel.app/api`.  Below the field, an error message is displayed: `TypeError: Failed to fetch`.  This suggests that the provided URL, or possibly the API endpoint at that URL, is currently inaccessible or has failed to respond.

**Overall:**

The image captures a step-by-step guide to building and deploying a simple API on Vercel.  The error message indicates that either the deployment process is not complete, there is a problem with the API implementation, or there's an issue with the network connection or the server itself.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser window. 


**Browser Window Details:**

* **Address Bar:** The address bar displays a Vercel URL: `tdsproject1-tjsdp1-2312003853-projects.vercel.app/api?name=sLrAoQ&name=d2KY`.  This indicates a web application hosted on Vercel.
* **Tab Titles:**  Multiple tabs are visible in the browser window, including "My Dashboard," "Graded Ass," "TDS 2025 Jn," "Vercel," "tdsproject," "Introducing," "Deploy Pyn," and another "tdsproject."  This suggests a development environment or project management interface.
* **Code Editor/Console:** The main part of the window shows a code editor or console. It contains a small snippet of code that appears to be using Python's `pretty-print` function (or a similar function) and displays JSON data: `{"marks":[3,41]}`.
* **Browser Controls:** Standard browser controls (back, forward, refresh, etc.) are visible.


**Content Interpretation:**

The displayed JSON data suggests the code is processing or displaying a dictionary with a "marks" key containing a list of numbers. The "pretty-print" line indicates an attempt to format this data for easier readability.  The multiple tabs suggest this is likely a development or debugging environment, potentially for a web application hosted on Vercel.

In short, the image shows a developer's browser window working on or debugging code related to a web application project hosted on Vercel.

This url shows correct but after few hour it shows this error  
@carlton pls help me to fix this
This image shows a code block with instructions and an error message.  Here's a breakdown:

**Instructions:**

1. **Download Llamafile:**  The instructions begin by telling the user to download a file named "Llamafile".

2. **Run the model:** The user is then instructed to run a specific Llama language model (`Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6 K.llamafile`) using the downloaded Llamafile.

3. **Create a tunnel with ngrok:** The next step involves creating a tunnel to the Llamafile server using the `ngrok` tool.  `ngrok` is a service that creates temporary URLs for exposing local servers to the internet.

4. **ngrok URL:** The instructions explain what the `ngrok` URL might look like, providing a sample URL format: `https://[random].ngrok-free.app/`.  The `[random]` part indicates a randomly generated unique identifier.

5. **Example ngrok URL:** A specific `ngrok` URL is then shown: `https://6714-13-71-3-97.ngrok-free.app/`. This is likely the URL generated by `ngrok` for the user's server.


**Error Message:**

Below the example `ngrok` URL is an error message indicating that the response from the server is too old.  The error message contains a JSON-like structure, which seems to include:

* **finish_reason:** "stop" (the model stopped generating text)
* **index:** 0 (likely the index of the first choice)
* **message:** This part is partially visible, showing parts of a message, possibly user input and generated output, along with some internal identifiers.
* **created:** A timestamp representing when the response was generated.
* **id:** A unique ID for the response.
* **model:** "unknown" (the model type couldn't be determined)
* **object:** "chat.completion" (indicates a chat completion response)
* **completion_tokens, prompt_tokens, total_tokens:**  These indicate token counts, relevant for measuring the length of the prompt and response.

**Overall:**

The image shows a troubleshooting scenario.  The user successfully generated a `ngrok` URL for their Llamafile server, but encountered an error because the response from the server was too old, suggesting a timing or caching issue. The error message details provide clues for debugging.  The red warning icon next to the example ngrok URL further highlights the error.

Here's a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a video conferencing session, likely a screen share of a coding session.  The top shows a typical video conferencing toolbar with mute, camera, share screen, and hangup buttons.  A person named Saransh is identified in the participant list.  At the bottom left, "Saransh is presenting" is displayed, indicating the presenter's identity.  A small profile picture of Saransh is also visible in the participant list on the bottom right.


The main content of the screen share is a Python code editor showing a FastAPI application.  The code appears to read data from a CSV file ("data.csv") and provides a simple API endpoint ("/api") that returns city and population data based on a query parameter.  The code includes comments explaining the use of `allow_credentials`, `allow_methods`, and `allow_headers`.  The line numbers in the code editor are visible.  The editor's status bar shows file name (fast.py), line and column numbers, the encoding (UTF-8), and the Python version.  There are also IDE features like Go Live and Prettier buttons visible, suggesting an integrated development environment.  The top right corner of the image shows a low battery indicator and Wifi signal strength.  The time at the top left indicates the time of the screenshot.

Hi Srividya,

Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.  
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.

This renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).

In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You *do not* create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.

This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.

Thanks for your input.

Kind regards

Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side. Right now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during evaluation.

What am i missing here? i am also facing same issue, question 9 . attached screenshots.

Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 6.15.03 PM1920×1200 77.8 KB

  

Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 6.13.02 PM1920×1200 178 KB
The image shows a computer screen displaying a web page with a JSON diff tool. The top of the screen shows tabs for various web pages, including "docker hub," "Google," "localhost:8000/api," and "Graded Assignment."  The main content of the screen shows two columns of JSON data, side-by-side, with line numbers. The JSON data appears to be a list of objects, each containing a "class" and a "studentId" property. The right-hand column is largely blank, implying a comparison between the left-hand column and an unseen, presumably empty or different, data set. The title bar indicates "JSON Diff - The sem" which suggests this is a tool for comparing semantic data. The URL bar at the top shows "jsondff.com," which is likely the web address of the tool.
 The image shows a web browser window with a programming assignment and the results of testing an API. Let's break down the key elements:

**Top Section:**

* **Browser Tab:** The tabs at the top show various websites and tools, suggesting the user is working on a development task.  Noticeable tabs include `localhost:8000/api`, `JSON Diff`, and others related to deployment and a specific institute (possibly educational).

* **Assignment Details:** A green box displays the assignment details:
    * **Due Date:** Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 PM IST
    * **Score:** 7.5/10
    * **Instructions:** The assignment instructs the student to create an API endpoint that filters student data based on a query parameter "class". The API should return only students belonging to the specified classes and maintain the order from a CSV file. It emphasizes the need to enable CORS for GET requests.  An example URL is given: `/api?class=1A`.

* **Error Message:**  A red box highlights an error message indicating that the API's response does not match the expected output. The expected output is shown as a JSON array of student IDs and their classes.

* **Check Button:** A "Check" button suggests the user can resubmit their work for grading.

**Middle Section:**

This section appears to be the browser's developer tools (likely Chrome DevTools).

* **Network Tab:** The most relevant portion here is the "Network" tab, which displays the details of the API request made by the user. The request URL includes multiple class parameters (`/api?class=1A&class=BN&class=8X&class=42`). The response section shows the actual JSON response received from the API. By comparing this to the expected output, one can easily see discrepancies.

**Bottom Section:**

This section contains more details from the developer tools, showing request and response headers, and other debugging information.

**Overall:**

The image shows a student working on a FastAPI assignment, encountering an error where the API's response doesn't match the expected output. The developer tools' Network tab and the comparison between the expected and actual responses are key to identifying and resolving the problem.  The error message points to a mismatch in the JSON data returned by the API. The student needs to adjust their API code to produce the correct filtered student data as specified in the assignment instructions.

Hi @23f2004644 and @bhashwar\_sengupta ,

You would need to keep all the servers active whenever you click on save button.

So if I kept the server running and saved the answer, but after reloading it’s showing incorrect  
We can’t just keep it running.

Hi @daksh76 ,

I didn’t actually used python to solve this particular question. I tried for some time but it was not working. So I just used Squoosh, for now pls use this.

whenever you want to submit your answers by pressing save button at that time only all servers should must be running.

I did that, while running all the severs i saved my answers and it showed “correct”.  
But after sometime when I re-loaded my answers it showed incorrect.

Hi @24ds1000082\_Vivek, @23f3004114 ,

You guys are not using correct format for response.

```
{
  "students": [
    {
      "studentId": 1,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 2,
      "class": "1B"
    }, ...
  ]
}

```

This is correct for which have a object with key `students` which is not present in your response.

kind regards

@ carlton @ Jivraj  
Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.  
Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.  
Do I need to do anything else ?  
Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.  
Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

Week-2 Question-8, I am getting error

image1730×387 32.5 KB

I have pushed my image in the repository, pulled it and ran once, it worked

This is how my docker hub repository looks,

image2239×1129 278 KB

`https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general`
The image shows a web form asking for a Docker image URL.  The form provides an example of the correct format: `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general`.  The user has inputted `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general`.  However, below the input field, there is an error message: "Error: 23f2000573 is not one of the tags in https://hub.docker.com/v2/namespaces/23f2000573/repositories/first-rep/tags".  This indicates that while the URL structure is correct, the specific tag `23f2000573` is invalid.  A "Check" button is present, presumably to validate the user input.
 The image shows a terminal window displaying a Docker command. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **`giri@GIRI:~$`**: This is the terminal prompt, indicating the user "giri" is logged in on a machine named "GIRI". The `$` signifies a regular user, not root.

* **`docker run 23f2000573/first-rep:v1 abc.py`**: This is the Docker command being executed. Let's break it down further:
    * `docker run`: This is the command to start a new Docker container.
    * `23f2000573/first-rep:v1`: This is the Docker image name.  `23f2000573` likely represents a user or organization ID, and `first-rep:v1` is the repository name and tag (version v1).
    * `abc.py`: This is the command or script to be executed inside the newly created container.  It suggests a Python script.

The presence of `abc.py` after the image name indicates that the script `abc.py` within the container's filesystem will be executed when the container starts.  The output of `abc.py` (if any) will likely appear below the command in the terminal.  A portion of this output may be cut off in the image.
 The image shows a screenshot of a Docker Hub repository page. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Top Bar:** A standard browser address bar shows the URL `hub.docker.com/repository/docker/23f2000573/first-rep/general`, indicating the repository's location on Docker Hub.  Also visible are various browser tabs and extensions.

* **Docker Hub Navigation:** The Docker Hub website's top navigation bar is present, with options like "Explore," "Repositories," "Organizations," and "Usage."  A search bar is also visible.  A banner ad promoting "More Docker, Easy Access, New Streamlined Plans" is displayed.

* **Repository Information:**  The main content displays information about the repository `23f2000573/first-rep`.  Key details include:

    * **Repository Name:** `23f2000573/first-rep`
    * **Last Pushed:** The time the repository was last updated (19 minutes ago in the image).
    * **Repository Size:** 364.1 MB
    * **Options to Add:**  Sections to add a description and a category to the repository.
    * **Tabs:**  Several tabs are shown at the top of this section: "General," "Tags," "Builds," "Collaborators," "Webhooks," and "Settings."  The "General" and "Tags" tabs are selected.
    * **Tags Table:** A table lists the tags associated with the repository, including the tag name ("v1"), OS, Type ("image"), and timestamps for when the tag was pulled and pushed.
    * **Docker Commands:** Instructions are provided on how to push a new tag to this repository using the `docker push` command. A "Public view" button is also shown.
    * **Automated Builds:**  Information about automated builds, indicating the need for a Pro, Team, or Business subscription to enable this feature. An "Upgrade" button is visible.


* **User Information:** In the top right corner, the user appears to have 2 private repositories available (indicated by the "2" notification icon).

In summary, the screenshot provides a comprehensive view of a specific Docker Hub repository, showing its metadata, associated tags, and instructions for interaction.

In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with `--n-gpu-layers 35` parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.  
@carlton @Jivraj did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

image837×232 10.8 KB

  
please look into this @Jivraj @carlton @Saransh\_Saini  
https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m
The image shows a browser window displaying a JSON response. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Browser Address Bar:**  The address bar shows the URL `new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api?name=Mn&name=m`. This suggests a web application deployed on Vercel, with a query parameter `name`.  The repeated `name` parameter might indicate a bug or inconsistency in the URL. Standard browser navigation controls (back, forward, refresh) are visible.


* **Browser Tabs:** Three tabs are partially visible. One shows "iitm-tds-project1/sc...", another "PROJECT2/autolysis...", and a third that is titled "Indian Institute of T...".


* **JSON Response:** The main area of the window shows a JSON object: `{"marks": [5,78]}`. This is formatted in a way that suggests a "pretty-print" option was enabled, making the JSON more readable.


* **Pretty-Print Checkbox:** A checkbox labeled "Pretty-print" is visible, likely indicating the option to enable or disable pretty-printing of JSON data.

The overall context suggests that the user is interacting with a web API that returns JSON data containing a list of marks. The Vercel URL implies a serverless function or API backend.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web interface, likely a testing or debugging tool.  The main focus is a form asking for a Vercel URL.

**Key Elements:**

* **Instruction:**  The text "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: https://your-app.vercel.app/api" provides instructions on the expected format of the URL.  The example shows a URL structure with the `your-app` placeholder, suggesting the user needs to replace this with their specific application name.

* **Input Field:** A text input field displays the user's entered URL: "https://new-deploy12345.vercel.app/api". This URL appears to be correctly formatted based on the example.

* **Error Message:** A red error message below the input field states: "Error: Expected [98,92,56,72,17] but got [48,"Not Found","Not Found","Not Found","Not Found"]". This indicates a problem with the application's response.  The expected values appear to be a numerical array, while the actual response contains the string "Not Found" multiple times, suggesting the application's endpoint at that URL is not returning the anticipated data.

* **Check Button:** A blue button labeled "Check" is present, implying the user can submit the URL for verification.


**In summary:** The image depicts a test or validation process for a Vercel deployment. The user has provided what seems to be a correctly formatted URL, but the backend application is returning "Not Found" errors, indicating an issue with the deployment or the API endpoint.

Try these @21f3000745

1. Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.  
   **If this doesn’t work, then:**
2. Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.
3. Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

Hi @24DS1000121\_ULAGAOOZ ,

For the **ngrok tunnel** question and any other question requiring a server URL, make sure to **keep all servers running** when clicking the **Save** button.

Also, I couldn’t find the **GitHub Pages URL** in your **GA2 response**, and many answers are unmarked. It seems you **didn’t click the Save button**.

Your current score is **4.5/10**.

Not able to submit GA2 assignment Since I’m seeing this page there is no submit button available.Will it take last saved for submission.
The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying an online course's graded assignment details. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Browser Window:** A standard web browser window is visible, with the URL bar showing a link related to an online course ("seek.onlinedegree.litm.ac.in/courses..."). Standard browser controls (back, forward, refresh, etc.) are also seen.  Bookmarks and browser extensions are visible at the top right.

* **Course Navigation:** The left-hand side shows a course navigation menu with sections like "Modules," "Grades," and subsections for specific modules (e.g., "Module 1: Development Tools," "Module 2: Deployment Tools," "Graded Assignment 2").  "Graded Assignment 2" is highlighted, indicating the current focus.

* **Graded Assignment Details (Right-hand side):** This section provides important information about the assignment:
    * **Due Date:** Clearly stated with time zone (IST).
    * **Submission Policy:** Mentions multiple submissions allowed, with only the last one graded.
    * **Troubleshooting:**  A section addressing potential access issues, mentioning the need to disable ad blockers, cookies, and specific browser extensions. It recommends Chrome and cautions against overly aggressive antivirus software.
    * **Student ID Requirement:**  Emphasizes the mandatory use of the student ID for submission.
    * **Assignment Link:** Provides a direct link to access the assignment itself.

* **Date and Course Name:** The top left corner indicates the date ("Jan 2025 - TDS") and suggests the course name ("IT Matras").

In summary, the image displays a comprehensive view of a student's online course, specifically focusing on a graded assignment's instructions, deadlines, and troubleshooting guidance.  The image is highly relevant to questions about online course management systems, assignment details, troubleshooting access problems, and online learning platforms.

Screenshot 2025-02-02 1948011626×531 38 KB
The image shows a screenshot of a terminal window in a code editor, likely VS Code or a similar IDE. The terminal displays output related to a FastAPI application running on a local server (127.0.0.1:8000).

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

* **Top Bar:** Shows tabs for "Problems," "Output," "Debug Console," "TERMINAL," and "PORTS."  The title bar indicates the terminal is running `python3.12 - Fastapi`.

* **Terminal Output:** The main part of the image shows the terminal output.  Key points include:

    * **Directory Monitoring:** The application is monitoring a specific directory on the Windows file system (`F:\\BS DATA SCIENCE\\Diploma Level\\TERM 2\\TDS\\Week 2\\Fastapi`) for changes.
    * **Uvicorn Server:** Uvicorn, an ASGI server, is running the FastAPI application.  The process ID is 17712. A reloader process (18904) is also running using StatReload, automatically restarting the server when code changes are detected.
    * **HTTP Requests:** Several HTTP requests are logged, indicating that clients are accessing the API:
        * The first two requests (`/` and `/favicon.ico`) result in `404 Not Found` errors, meaning those routes are not defined in the API.
        * Subsequent requests to `/api` and `/api?class=1A` return `200 OK`, indicating successful responses.

* **Overall:** The output suggests a FastAPI application is successfully running, serving requests, and configured for automatic reloading on code changes. The 404 errors indicate that the routes for the root path ("/") and the favicon are not handled.  The successful 200 OK responses show the `/api` endpoint is working correctly with query parameters.
 The image shows a browser window displaying a JSON response. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Browser Window:** A standard web browser window is shown, with typical controls like back, forward, refresh buttons, and a URL bar.  The URL in the address bar shows `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A`, indicating an API call to a local server.

* **JSON Data:** The main part of the window shows a JSON structure, specifically a list of students, where each student object contains a `studentId` and a `class`. All students in this response are in class "1A".

* **"Pretty-print":**  The word "Pretty-print" is visible, suggesting that the JSON is formatted for readability.

* **Content of JSON:** The JSON data is a list of student objects, each having a student ID and the class they belong to ("1A").  There are multiple student ID numbers listed. The JSON is not completely shown, as the image only displays the beginning of the list.

In summary, the image captures a successful API call that returns a list of students from class "1A", neatly formatted in a JSON response within a web browser.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a code testing interface or a section of a web application designed for testing an API endpoint.  The main elements are:

* **Instructions:**  The top section provides instructions on how the API endpoint should behave.  It specifies that if a query parameter `class` is included in the URL, the API should return only students belonging to the specified classes. The order of students in the response should match the order in a CSV file, regardless of the order of classes in the query.  CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration is also mentioned.

* **API Endpoint Input Field:** A text input field is provided for the user to enter the API URL. An example URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`) is given as a hint.  The user has entered this URL.

* **Error Message:** Below the input field, an error message "TypeError: Failed to fetch" is displayed, indicating that the API request failed.

* **Verification Step:**  The instructions mention that a request will be sent to the entered URL with a `?class...` parameter to verify the response data against expected data.

* **"Check" Button:**  A button labeled "Check" is at the bottom, presumably to initiate the API request and validation process.


In essence, the image displays a stage in the testing process of a FastAPI (likely a Python web framework) application. The user has attempted to provide the API endpoint, but an error occurred during the fetch attempt, suggesting potential issues with the server or networking configuration.

Hi @23f2000573 ,

As error mentions to add tag to image.

Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled.

For adding tag use  

image1351×578 40.8 KB
This image shows a code snippet demonstrating how to build, run, and deploy a container using `podman`.  The instructions are broken down into sections with comments:

1. **Login:**  The first step is to create a Docker Hub account and log in using `podman login docker.io`.

2. **Build and Run:** The container (named `py-hello`) is built using `podman build -t py-hello` and then run interactively in the foreground using `podman run -it py-hello`.

3. **Push to Docker Hub:** The built container is pushed to the user's Docker Hub repository.  The command `podman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello` highlights the importance of replacing `$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` with the actual Docker Hub username.  This pushes the `latest` tag.

4. **Push with a Specific Tag:** The final section illustrates pushing the container with a specific tag (e.g., `dev`) using `TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG`.  This is useful for version control or different deployment environments.

The overall background is dark, making the light-colored code easily readable.  The comments (#) before each section clearly delineate the purpose of the code blocks.  The image provides a concise tutorial for container deployment using podman.

For GA2 there is not question that asks if you visited GA2 page or not.  
Just answer on GA2 page TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - Deployment Tools.

Hi @24f1002359

For **Question 10**, ensure that **all servers are running** every time you submit (click the **Save** button). Since **ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs**, double-check that the **ngrok URL is correct** before submitting.

For **Question 9**, did you **enable CORS**? To verify, check your **browser console**—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.

Kind regards.
The image shows a browser's developer console output. The console displays messages related to an AJAX request made to `http://google.com`.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Top Bar:** Standard browser developer tools tabs are visible: Elements, Console, Sources, Network, Performance, Memory, and Application.  The "1" in a red circle indicates an error.

* **Console Messages:** The console shows three messages:

    * `"starting ajax request to the resource."` - Indicates the beginning of an AJAX request.
    * `"ajax request done."` - Shows that the AJAX request completed.
    * **Error Message:**  This is the critical message:  `"Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://google.com/' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."` This is a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error.  It means the request from the current website (origin `null`, likely because it's a `file://` local file) to `google.com` was blocked because `google.com` didn't send the necessary `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response.  This header tells the browser it's okay for the request to come from a specific origin (or any origin, using `*`).


* **Line Numbers:** Each message is associated with a line number from `index.html`.  This helps pinpoint the location of the AJAX call in the code.

In summary, the image depicts a common web development error where a CORS policy prevents an AJAX call from succeeding.  The error highlights a missing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on the server-side (google.com).  Solving this requires configuring the server to allow requests from the origin making the AJAX request.

for question 9 u can use ,

`from fastapi import FastAPI, Query`

and
The image contains a snippet of Python code, specifically a function definition within a FastAPI application. Let's break down the code:


**`@app.get("/api")`**: This is a FastAPI decorator.  It indicates that the following function (`api`) will be exposed as an HTTP GET endpoint at the URL `/api`.


**`def api(...)`**: This line defines a Python function named `api`. This function is the handler for the `/api` endpoint.


**`class_: Annotated[list[str] | None, Query(alias='class')] = None`**: This is the most complex part, defining the input parameter `class_`.  Let's unpack it:

* **`class_`**:  The name of the function's parameter. Note the underscore; this is common in Python when a variable name might conflict with a keyword.
* **`Annotated[...]`**: This is a type hint from the `typing_extensions` library (likely imported elsewhere in the code). It allows combining multiple type hints and metadata.
* **`list[str]`**: This means the parameter `class_` is expected to be a list of strings.
* **`| None`**: This means the parameter can also be `None`. This makes the parameter optional.
* **`Query(alias='class')`**: This comes from FastAPI's `Query` function. It specifies that this parameter will be obtained from the query parameters of the HTTP request.  `alias='class'` indicates that the query parameter should be named "class" (without the underscore) in the HTTP request. The default value is None.
* **`= None`**: This sets a default value for the parameter to `None`. If the "class" query parameter isn't present in the HTTP request, `class_` will have a value of `None`.

**`= None` (at the end of the line)**: This sets the default value of the `api` function's parameter `class_` to `None`.


**In essence:** This code defines an API endpoint that accepts an optional query parameter named "class".  The value of this parameter should be a list of strings, but it's also possible to omit it.  The function then presumably does something with this list (or `None` if the parameter is not provided).

Sir, the page I have published via GITHUB is as below:  

image3072×1920 200 KB
The image shows a screenshot of a GitHub Pages settings page. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** The top shows standard browser elements (back button, forward button, address bar showing the GitHub URL, etc.).  Several tabs are open in the browser, hinting at other related tasks or projects.

* **GitHub Interface:** The main portion shows the GitHub interface for managing a GitHub Pages site. The repository name is `ULAGADOZHIAN/TDS-page`.

* **Left Sidebar:** A navigation sidebar shows options like Code, Issues, Pull Requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, and Settings.  Under "Settings" are options for General settings, Access, Collaboration, Moderation, Code and Automation, Branches, Tags, Rules, Actions, Webhooks, Environments, Codespaces, and Pages (the currently selected section). Finally, there are sections for Security (Code security, Deploy keys, Secrets and variables), Integrations (GitHub Apps, Email notifications).

* **Main Content Area:**  This section contains information about the GitHub Pages site:
    * **GitHub Pages Overview:**  Explains the purpose of GitHub Pages.
    * **Site URL:** Shows the live URL of the deployed site: `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/`  (with a "Visit site" button).  Deployment time is also shown.
    * **Build and Deployment:** Section to manage the source, branch, and deployment settings.  It shows that the site is built from the `main` branch.
    * **Custom Domain:** Section allowing configuration of a custom domain to replace the GitHub Pages default.  Options to save or remove are present.
    * **Enforce HTTPS:** Checkbox to enforce HTTPS for the site.

* **Bottom Bar:** A standard Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom with several application icons.


In essence, the image shows a user in the process of configuring their GitHub Pages website, specifically working within the settings section to manage its deployment, branch, and potentially its custom domain. The screenshot provides valuable information about the site's status and configuration.
 The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a web page, likely an online exam or assignment. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** Standard browser tabs are visible at the top, showing various web pages related to a course or project (e.g., "My Dashboard," "WOLI: Complex," "BDM Capstone," "About the Course"). The current page is titled "Pages" and shows a URL that points to an exam within a development environment.  A "Navigation privée" (private navigation) icon is also visible.

* **Exam Interface:** The main section is an online exam with a timer ("01:37:36 left") and a score display ("Score: 0/10").  There are buttons for "Check all" and "Save."

* **Coding Task:** The exam includes a question asking the user to publish a webpage using GitHub Pages, showcasing their work. It emphasizes that the GitHub pages are served via CloudFlare, which obfuscates emails. The task instructs the user to wrap their email address (provided) within a specific HTML tag. The example HTML tag and email address are presented.

* **GitHub Pages URL:** A field is provided to enter the correct GitHub Pages URL. The user has entered an attempt (`https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/?v=1, ?v=2`) that is being evaluated.

* **HTML Code:** An error message is displayed below the URL input. The message shows the user's HTML code, highlighting that the intended email address is not included in the response. 

* **Error Message:** The error message reveals the HTML structure the user submitted and shows that the email obfuscation is not working. The `email-protection` class and the `cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js` script indicate the use of Cloudflare's email protection service.

* **Cache Busting:** There is a note about adding `?v=1, ?v=2` to the URL to bust the cache. This implies a potential caching issue preventing the correct updated page from being loaded.

* **Check Button:** A "Check" button allows the user to submit their answer for grading.

* **Bottom Bar:** The typical Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom of the image showing open applications.

In short, the screenshot depicts a student working on a coding assignment that requires them to properly use GitHub Pages, Cloudflare's email obfuscation, and understand how to handle caching mechanisms in their HTML. The assignment is part of a larger course or program.
 The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a webpage titled "My Model Page". 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Webpage Content:** The webpage is primarily blank, with only a title ("My Model Page") and contact information ("Contact me at: 24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in") at the top.  The URL in the address bar shows it's hosted on GitHub.

* **Browser Tabs:** The browser's tab bar at the top displays several other tabs related to what looks like a course or educational platform. Titles include "My Dashboard," "WOL: Complex Data," "BOM Capstone," "About the Course," "Graded Assignment," and "TDS 2025 Jan GA2."

* **Browser Interface:** Standard browser controls (back, forward, refresh, etc.) are visible.  The browser appears to be Chrome or a Chromium-based browser.

* **Operating System:** The taskbar at the bottom indicates a Windows operating system, with various application icons visible. The language appears to be French, as indicated by the "Rechercher" (search) text in the taskbar.

* **Time and Date:** The system clock in the bottom right corner shows the time as 17:58 and the date as 02/02/2005.


In summary, the image shows a simple, mostly empty webpage within a browser window, along with several other browser tabs suggesting an online learning environment. The date on the taskbar seems highly unlikely to be correct; it's likely an error.

Hi @24DS1000121\_ULAGAOOZ ,

That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a `.nojekyll` file in your root folder of your repository.

This image shows a developer's browser window, specifically the Developer Tools section, during a debugging session for a GitHub Pages website. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Top Bar:** Shows standard browser controls, including the address bar, and a timer indicating a remaining time of "01:19:33 left". A score of "0/10" suggests a test or challenge is in progress.

* **Left Panel:** Displays information related to the website's development.

    * **GitHub Pages URL Question:** A prompt asking for the correct GitHub Pages URL, providing a template of `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`.
    * **Attempted URL:** The user's provided URL: `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/`.
    * **Error Message:**  A detailed error message indicating that a specific email address (`24ds1000121@ds.study.uitm.ac.in`) isn't found in the website's HTML response. It then displays a snippet of the HTML source code, revealing how the email address is obfuscated using Javascript and Cloudflare's email protection.
    * **Caching Advice:**  Instructions to add `?v=1` or `?v=2` to the URL to clear the browser cache if changes aren't reflected.

* **Main Panel (Network Tab):** This is the central part of the image, displaying the Network tab in the browser's developer tools.

    * **Website Preview:**  A preview of the website shows the title "My Model Page" and the obfuscated email address.
    * **Request Details:** The panel displays the requested resource (`TDS-page/`), along with the transferred data size and other metrics.
    * **Timings:**  A timeline showing different stages of the page load, categorized by type (Fetch/XHR, Doc, CSS, JS, etc.).

* **Bottom Panel:** Shows the usual developer tool tabs (Console, Developer resources, Network conditions, Issues, Performance monitor).


In summary, the image depicts a common situation in web development where a developer is trying to troubleshoot why a recently-made change to a GitHub Pages website isn't showing up in the browser.  The error likely stems from a caching issue, but the core problem is in the HTML itself. The obfuscated email shows the developer used a tool to help protect it from being automatically harvested by email scrapers.

I am facing this issue. It is stating the error as mentioned  

image1630×575 64 KB

The /api is working perfectly fine manually either I specify the class or without it  

image1917×976 180 KB

Sample class example that I tried manually is below  

image1919×1079 185 KB

The main code is below

```
import sys


sys.path.append("C:\\Users\\Deveshu Pathak\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\\LocalCache\\local-packages\\Python312\\Scripts")
# tds_q9.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  
    allow_headers=["*"],  
)

# Load CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("q-fastapi.csv")

@app.get("/api")
def get_students(class_: list[str] = Query(None, alias="class")):
    if class_:
        filtered_df = df[df["class"].isin(class_)]
    else:
        filtered_df = df

    # Convert to dictionary list
    students = filtered_df.to_dict(orient="records")
    return {"students": students}

```
This image shows a code debugging session, likely from a development environment. The primary focus is on a FastAPI application that fetches student data from a CSV file based on class query parameters.

Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**1. API Specification:** The top section describes the API's functionality.  It clarifies that:

* The API endpoint should accept a `class` query parameter (e.g., `/api?class=1A`).
* Multiple classes can be specified (e.g., `/api?class=1A&class=1B`).
* The API should return only students belonging to the specified classes, maintaining the order present in the original CSV file.
* CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) should be enabled to allow GET requests from any origin.

**2. API Endpoint:** A text box displays the API URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. This is a common local development address.

**3. Error Response:** A large portion of the image shows an error message indicating a mismatch between the expected API response and the actual response. The expected and actual responses are both presented as nested JSON arrays, each entry containing a `studentId` and `class`. The discrepancy highlights a bug in the API's data retrieval or filtering logic.

**4. Testing Instruction:** The last line explains that the next step in the debugging process involves sending requests to the API with different `class` parameters to verify the data consistency.


**In short:** The image captures a crucial part of the debugging process for a FastAPI application handling student data.  The primary issue is an error in the data returned by the API, which doesn't match the expected output based on the provided query parameters.  The error message provides detailed information to help identify and fix the problem.
 The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying a large JSON data structure. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **JSON Data:** The main focus is a lengthy JSON array named "students." Each element within this array represents a student, containing two key-value pairs:  `"studentId"` (a number) and `"class"` (a seemingly random alphanumeric string). The data is very long, showing numerous student records.

* **Browser Interface:** The browser window shows various tabs/buttons at the top, including some likely related to web development (e.g., "CS50," "Programming," "Hack2skill,"  "Coding Conquest").  The URL bar shows a local address (`127.0.0.1:8000/api`). The browser's address bar indicates that the JSON data comes from an API endpoint.

* **Pretty-print:** In the top-left corner, the words "Pretty-print" are visible, suggesting that the JSON is formatted for readability (indented).

The image primarily serves to display a significant amount of structured data in JSON format, possibly for use in a web application or for debugging purposes. The data itself doesn't follow any immediately obvious pattern in the class assignments.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a web browser window with a JSON response in the console. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Browser Window:** The main focus is a dark-themed web browser (likely Chrome or a similar browser).  The URL bar shows `127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=3Q`, indicating a local API call targeting class 3Q. Several tabs are visible in the browser window, suggesting multiple active tasks (AI, CSS, Programming, goodreads.com, etc.).

* **JSON Response:** The browser console displays a JSON response.  The JSON is formatted using `pretty-print`, making it readable.  The data is a list of students, each with a `studentId` and `class` (which is "3Q" in all the displayed cases).

* **Operating System:** The bottom of the screenshot reveals a taskbar, suggesting a Windows or similar operating system.

* **System Resources:** A small system monitor shows CPU usage at 90%, GPU at 25%, and RAM usage (the exact percentage is partially obscured). The time and date are visible (22:46, 02-02-2025).

In short, the image captures a moment during a software development or data analysis task involving a local API call returning student data. The high CPU usage might indicate the program is performing a task or handling a relatively large amount of data.

The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.

If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.

I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.

We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students.

If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

Regards,  
TDS TA

Does this go for GA1 also ?
That's a blurry, low-resolution image of a man. 


Here's what can be observed:

* **The Man:** He appears to be middle-aged, with a mustache. He's wearing a horizontally striped short-sleeved shirt (darker stripes on a lighter background, possibly blue and white or similar colors) and blue jeans. He seems to be sitting.  His expression is somewhat indistinct due to the image quality. He's wearing a dark-colored cap or hat.

* **The Background:** The background is extremely out of focus, but appears to be an outdoor or possibly semi-outdoor setting. There are indistinct shapes and colors that suggest a possibly busy or cluttered environment, perhaps a market or street scene.  There's no clear detail to discern specific objects.

* **Image Quality:** The photograph is significantly blurry and low resolution, making it difficult to see fine details or accurately describe specific colors.

There is no discernible text in the image.  The lack of clarity prevents a more detailed description.

Yes. The scores you achieve in the TDS portal are your scores for the GA. It’s not necessary to do anything on the Seek Portal.

Thank you for your attention to our problems you are the real heroes.

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying an online assessment or quiz. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** The browser window shows several tabs, suggesting multiple online learning or development tools are open ("Outline - IITM Online Degree," "Tools in Data Science," "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development," and "GA2 - Deployment Tools").

* **Quiz Information:** A red banner at the top indicates the quiz has ended. It shows the end time ("Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"), the current score (0), and buttons to "Check all" and "Save."  A note below says that hacking the code or quiz is permissible.

* **Quiz Guidance:** The section below provides guidance on whether the user should take the course ("TDS"). It suggests that if the assignment is completed under 2 hours and a score above 8/10 is achieved, a good grade is likely.

* **Discourse Link:** A light-blue box encourages users to join a discussion on Discourse if they have questions.

* **Login Information:** It shows the user is logged in with the email address "22f2001630@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" and a "Logout" button.

* **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves" displays three entries, each showing a "Reload" button and indicating a save time of 1/25/2025, 10:56:53 PM, with a score of 6.5 for each save.

* **Bottom Section:** The bottom shows a "Questions" heading (presumably for further questions), a Windows activation prompt, and the typical Windows taskbar.

In summary, the image captures a student's view of an online quiz, possibly related to a data science course, after the quiz has ended.  The quiz appears to be part of a larger online learning platform.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying a student's online learning dashboard, likely from the IIT Madras online degree program.

**Key Elements:**

* **Top Bar:** The top bar displays several tabs, including "My Dashboard," "BDM Capstone," "Tools in Data Science," "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development," and "GA2 - Deployment Tools."  This suggests a curriculum involving data science and potentially business data management.

* **Login Information:** The top right corner shows the student's name, "TANMAY GARG," and a "SIGN OUT" button.

* **Date and Term:** The top right also indicates the current date, "03 February, 2025," and the academic term, "JANUARY 2025 TERM."

* **Course Information:** The main content area displays "My Current Courses," along with the student's cumulative grade point average (CGPA) - 8.3 - and project CGPA - 0.0.

* **Course and Project Cards:** Two prominent cards showcase the student's enrolled courses:
    * **"Tools in Data Science":**  This is labeled as a "NEW COURSE" and shows a "Week 1 Assignment" with a score of 65.00. There is a button to "Go to Course page".
    * **"Business Data Management - Project":** This is identified as a "RETRY PROJECT" and indicates a "Registered" status. A button is present to "Go to Project page".  This suggests a project-based component to the curriculum.

* **Navigation Pane:** A vertical navigation pane on the left side provides quick access to different sections of the learning management system.

* **Footer:**  A footer at the bottom contains a statement about harassment reporting and commitment to a respectful learning environment.  It also includes a contact email address.

* **Operating System:** The bottom right corner subtly displays the Windows operating system and its activation status.


The overall impression is that of a clean, organized online learning interface providing a student with a clear overview of their current courses, progress, and upcoming assignments.  The color scheme is predominantly dark, with accents of teal and white.

Hi Tanmay,

No need to worry. From Recent Saves top one will be selected for grading.

Screenshot from 2025-02-06 11-52-271626×535 33.9 KB
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a webpage, likely from an online quiz or assessment platform.  The overall color scheme is dark, with teal, dark green, and red accents. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar (Red):**  This displays "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" indicating the quiz's completion time.  Next to it are "Score: 0," a "Check all" button, and a "Save" button.

* **Question Area (Dark Gray):** The main area shows a question (number 7) stating that the quiz is "hackable," meaning the answers can be found by manipulating the code, and that this is allowed.

* **Discourse Link (Teal):** A prominent teal button encourages users with questions to join a discussion on Discourse, an online forum.

* **Login Status (Dark Gray):** This section confirms the user's login, displaying their email address: "23f2005327@ds.study.litm.ac.in". A "Logout" button is provided.

* **Recent Saves (Dark Green):** A dark green box shows information about recent saved attempts.  It indicates a "Reload" option and displays the date and time of the last save ("from 02/02/2025, 21:49:25") along with the achieved score ("Score: 5.5").


Overall, the image suggests an online quiz environment where code manipulation to find answers is permitted, providing a unique approach to assessment. The interface is clean and straightforward, with clear buttons and informative text.

I saved my responses for GA3 before deadline but still my responses disnt got evaluated.  

Screenshot from 2025-02-06 11-52-351626×535 34.8 KB
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a web page, likely an online assessment or quiz platform.  The overall color scheme is dark, with teal, dark green, and red accents.

**Top Section (Red):**

* **"Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"**: This indicates the quiz or assessment ended on that date and time (Indian Standard Time).
* **"Score: 0"**: Shows the user's current score.
* **"Check all"**: Likely a button to review all answers.
* **"Save"**: A button to save the progress.


**Mid-Section (Teal and Dark):**

* **"Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse"**:  A link to a discussion forum (likely Discourse).
* **"You are logged in as 23f2005327@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"**: Displays the currently logged-in user's email address, suggesting an academic or institutional context (likely Indian Institute of Technology Madras).
* **"Logout"**: A button to log out of the session.


**Bottom Section (Dark Green):**

* **"Recent saves"**:  A heading for the section below.
* **Three "Reload" entries**: Each entry displays a timestamp (date and time) and score for three previous save points.  These timestamps all fall on the same day as the quiz's ending time.  The scores indicate different progress points achieved before saving.


**Overall:**

The screenshot suggests a user has just completed (or ended their time on) an online quiz or assignment. The save points indicate attempts at different stages of the assessment. The presence of a Discourse link suggests community support or discussion surrounding the quiz.  The email address format implies an educational institution environment.
