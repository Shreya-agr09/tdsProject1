I wanted to seek clarification regarding the deadline for GA2. The latest email received today mentions the deadline as 26th January, whereas an earlier email stated 2nd February, which is also reflected on the dashboard.

Could you please confirm the correct deadline to avoid any confusion?

The image is a screenshot of an email. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Sender:** donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in  This suggests an automated email from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

* **Recipient:**  The "to" field shows that the email was sent to a mailing list, specifically "25t1_se2002-announce".

* **Salutation:** "Dear Learner," indicates the message is directed to students.

* **Body:** The main message states the deadline for a graded assignment covering weeks 1 and 2. The deadline is specified as 26/01/2025 23:59 Hrs. (January 26th, 2025, at 11:59 PM).

* **Closing:** "Warm Regards, IITM BS Team" is a formal closing, suggesting the message is from a team within the IITM BS (likely Bachelor of Science) program.

* **Timestamp:** "12:23 PM (7 minutes ago)" is in the upper right corner, showing when the screenshot was taken.  This implies the email was very recent at the time the image was captured.

In summary, the email is an automated notification to students about the deadline of an academic assignment.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Sender:** donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in  (This suggests an automated, non-reply email address from an institution).

* **Recipient:** 25t1_se2002-announce (This looks like a class or group email list).

* **Subject:**  The subject is not visible.

* **Body:** The email body is simple and concise:

    * "Dear Learner," (salutation)
    * "The deadline for the Week 1 & 2 Graded Assignment is 26/01/2025 23:59 Hrs." (This states the deadline for a graded assignment, clearly indicating the date and time)
    * "Warm Regards," (closing)
    * "IITM BS Team" (sender's name or team)

* **Timestamp:** 12:23 PM (7 minutes ago) (This indicates the time the email was received, suggesting it is fairly recent.)


The overall appearance suggests a simple, straightforward notification email from an educational institution, likely an automated system, concerning an assignment deadline.  The email's clear and precise language ensures there is no room for misinterpretation about the deadline.
