That's a digital image of a smiling emoticon, specifically a grinning emoji. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a circular yellow emoji with a gradient suggesting a slight three-dimensional effect, making the yellow slightly darker around the edges.

* **Facial Features:** The emoji features a wide, toothy grin. The teeth are white and prominently displayed, almost exaggeratedly large.  The eyes are simple, closed curves that suggest contentment or amusement, and the eyebrows are short, slightly curved lines that mirror the shape of the eyes.  There are no other facial features like a nose or pupils.

* **Style:** The style is consistent with commonly used emojis found in digital communication platforms and applications. The lines are simple and smooth; the overall style is cartoonish and cheerful.

The image is devoid of any text or background other than the black background created by the transparent area around the emoji itself.

Awaiting link  

image1920×1080 277 KB
The image shows a screenshot of a web page displaying information about the IIT Madras online exam. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Top Navigation Bar:** Shows standard browser controls (back, forward, refresh, etc.), the URL (`study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html`), and several browser tabs including "Remote Online Exam", "Home - Google Drive", and "Untitled0.ipynb - Colab".

* **IIT Madras Website Header:** Features the IIT Madras logo, the institute's name, and a navigation menu with links to various sections like "Academics," "Admissions," "Resources," "Student Life," "School Connect," "Achievements," "Events," "FAQ," "About IITM," "Partnerships," and "Placements". There is also a "Sign In" button.

* **Application Information Banner:** A red banner prominently displays application details: "Applications Open now for May 2025 Batch | Applications Close: May 20, 2025 | Exam: July 13, 2025" and an "APPLY NOW" button.

* **Exam Schedule Table:** This is the central part of the page. It shows the exam schedule for March 2nd, 2025, listing:
    * **Course Name:** Python A1 (P1 to P64), Python A2 (P65 to P128), and Java.
    * **Timing:** The time slots for each exam (e.g., 09:30 AM to 11:30 AM).
    * **Exam Link:** Hyperlinks to access each exam online.  The links have a consistent structure, indicating a pattern for directing students to the correct exam.

* **Important Links for OPPE:** A small section at the bottom of the table suggests additional relevant links for OPPE (presumably an abbreviation for a related program).

* **Bottom Bar:** The Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom, showing the time, date, and language settings.


In short, the image provides a clear view of the exam schedule and relevant information for IIT Madras students. The highlighted parts of the URLs within the exam link columns hint at a structured naming convention for the exam links based on course, section, and perhaps other identifying features.

That's an emoji! 


Specifically, it's a grinning face emoji with a very wide, toothy grin. The emoji is round, yellow, and has simple, curved eyes that are slightly closed, indicating happiness or amusement. The mouth is a large, open smile showing many, very white teeth. The style is consistent with common digital emoji designs, using a simple, cartoonish style for easy recognition.  There is no text present.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a webpage, likely related to online exam registration for IIT Madras. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Navigation Bar:** A standard browser tab bar is visible at the top, showing tabs for "Remote Online Exam," "Google Drive," and a Colab file. The URL bar displays `study.iitm.ac.in/ds/exam.html`.

* **IIT Madras Header:** The website header prominently features the IIT Madras logo and name. Navigation links across the top include "Academics," "Admissions," "Resources," "Student Life," "School Connect," "Achievements," "Events," "FAQ," "About IITM," "Partnerships," "Placements," and a "Sign In" button.

* **Application Banner:** A red banner announces that "Applications Open now for May 2025 Batch | Applications Close: May 20, 2025 | Exam: July 13, 2025" with an "APPLY NOW" button.

* **Exam Schedule Table:** A central table details exam information:
    * **Date:** March 02nd 2025
    * **Columns:** "COURSE NAME," "TIMING," and "EXAM LINK."
    * **Rows:** Three rows list exams for Python A1 (P1 to P64), Python A2 (P65 to P128), and Java, each with its specific time slot and a unique exam link. The links appear to be unique identifiers for each course and student group.

* **Important Links:** At the bottom of the exam schedule, there is a mention of "Important Links for OPPE."

* **Bottom Bar:** A typical Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom of the screenshot.


The overall impression is that this is a student portal or a section of an IIT Madras website dedicated to online exam scheduling and access. The highlighted links within the table are likely crucial for students to access their respective exams.

The image shows a webpage displaying an error message related to accessing a quiz. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Headline:** "Trouble seeing questions?" This suggests the primary issue is difficulty accessing or viewing the quiz content.

* **Troubleshooting Steps:**  A numbered list provides five steps for users to troubleshoot potential issues:

    1. Try a different browser (Chrome or Edge).
    2. Disable ad blockers or cookie blockers.
    3. Enable JavaScript.
    4. Try Incognito/InPrivate mode without browser extensions.
    5. Disable aggressive anti-virus software.

* **Error Message:** A pink box prominently displays an "Error!" message. The specific error is: "Sorry, we couldn't find the quiz tds-2025-01-roe. You might have the wrong link." This suggests the link provided may be incorrect or the quiz might not exist.

* **Contact Information:** Below the error, it advises users to "Please contact the exam team for assistance." This points towards a support mechanism for resolving the problem.

The overall appearance is a simple, clean webpage with clear instructions and error reporting. The color scheme is primarily light gray and pink, with dark gray used for the header and possibly the navigation bar (partially visible at the top).

Getting my pet ready to ace the roe.
That's a charming photo! 


Here's a description of the image:

Close-up view of a tabby cat sitting on a silver laptop computer. 


Here's a breakdown of the details:

* **The Cat:** A gray and brown tabby cat, with distinct stripes, is the central focus. It's positioned lengthwise on the laptop, its paws gently resting on the keyboard, as if it's intently watching the screen. Its green eyes are prominent, giving it an alert and curious expression.

* **The Laptop:** A silver laptop with a dark gray or black lid is slightly angled. A partially visible logo, which appears to be a stylized "LV" (or similar), is on the lid.

* **Accessories:** A red wireless computer mouse rests to the left of the keyboard. Several wires are visible, suggesting power cords and potentially other peripherals.

* **Background:** The background is blurry but shows a warm, dimly lit interior setting, suggesting a home environment. A portion of what appears to be a person's arm or clothing is visible in the upper left corner.

* **Surface:** The laptop and mouse sit on a reddish-brown surface, likely a table or desk.

The overall impression is one of a playful, almost humorous scene, portraying the cat as if it's using the computer. The lighting and focus draw the viewer's eye directly to the cat's expressive face and its position on the laptop.
 That's a digital image of a simple smiley-face emoticon. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** The emoticon is a circular yellow shape, slightly more golden-yellow in the center and fading to a slightly lighter yellow at the edges. This gives it a subtle three-dimensional appearance.

* **Features:** It has two small, dark brown, almost black, circular pupils/dots for eyes, positioned fairly close together and symmetrically on either side of the center. Below the eyes is a small, curved line forming a simple, closed-mouth smile. The smile is subtle and understated.

* **Style:** The style is minimalistic and resembles a classic smiley face, the type commonly used in early computer graphics and text-based communication.  It's not highly detailed; the features are basic shapes.

* **Background:** The background is transparent.

Challenging ROE. Definitely should’ve studied more
That's an emoji! 


It's a yellow circle representing a face, with the following features:

* **Eyes:** Two small, closed, curved lines suggesting a happy, slightly nervous squint.
* **Mouth:** A wide, open, upturned mouth with a pink tongue showing, indicating a big, joyful laugh.
* **Sweat Droplet:** A small, light-blue droplet is positioned on the upper right side of the face, suggesting nervousness or exertion while laughing. 


The overall impression is one of happy, nervous laughter, or perhaps relief after a stressful situation.  The emoji is cartoonish and simplistic in design.

Screenshot (92)1920×1080 352 KB

  
@carlton @Saransh\_Saini Sir, can you please tell me why this was not accepted? here is my code:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
            return response.text
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

```

here are the responses:

```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - "OPTIONS /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     127.0.0.1:51793 - "GET /api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.org%2Fget%3Fx%3D87738 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

```
The image shows a split screen.  The left half displays a browser window showing a coding exam interface.  The right half shows a Thunder Client window, a tool for making HTTP requests.  Let's break down the content:

**Left Side (Coding Exam):**

* **Exam Interface:** A web page presents a coding exam with several questions.  The questions involve different tasks, including working with Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings, finding regions containing points, determining shortest paths between cities, calculating correlations, and writing a FastAPI proxy server.

* **FastAPI Proxy Server Question:** This is the main focus. The instructions ask to build a FastAPI proxy server that forwards requests to a given URL while adding a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) header to the response.  A specific example is provided using `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` as the proxy endpoint.  The student is asked to provide their proxy's endpoint URL in an input field.  There's an error message indicating an incorrect response.

* **Score:** The student's score is currently 0/10.

* **Timer:** A timer shows 26 minutes and 36 seconds remaining.


**Right Side (Thunder Client):**

* **HTTP Requests History:** Thunder Client shows a history of past HTTP requests, many directed to various URLs including `127.0.0.1:8000`, indicating testing and debugging.  A recent request with a GET method is visible targeting the specified API endpoint including URL parameters.

* **Response:** The current response (Status 200 OK) from the server displays HTML content, which is likely the data being proxied.  This response is likely what the student's proxy server is aiming to return with the CORS header added.


**Overall:**

The image shows a student actively working on a coding exam question involving building a FastAPI proxy server.  They're using Thunder Client to test their solution against the provided requirements and examples.  The error message suggests they haven't successfully implemented the CORS header requirement yet.  The Thunder Client history suggests iterative testing and debugging.

ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it.

Your answer is absolutely correct @23f2000573  
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, @carlton @Saransh\_Saini

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.  
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode

Kind Regards,  
Muthu
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a pale green rectangular box containing a heading, a button, and some text. 


* **Heading:** The text "Recent saves" is prominently displayed in a bold, dark font at the top. Following this, in a smaller, lighter font, is "(most recent is your...". The "..." suggests the sentence is cut off.


* **Button:** A light blue rectangular button sits below the heading. The word "Reload" is written in a slightly darker blue font within the button.


* **Date and Time:** Below the button, the text "from 3/2/2025, 1:47:43 PM. S" provides a date and time stamp, likely indicating the time of the most recent save. The "S" at the end is unclear without more context.


The overall appearance suggests a user interface element from a software application, likely a game or program with saving capabilities. The "Reload" button implies the user can restore their game or work from the specified save point.

Hello @carlton  
@Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and dint get submitted properly…

As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.  

WhatsApp Image 2025-03-02 at 14.00.08\_d5cd67401280×720 111 KB

Hoping for a positive response from your side sir.

The image shows a screenshot of a web browser displaying an online exam results page. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** A standard browser address bar shows the URL `https://exam.sanandworkers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe`, indicating an online exam platform.  Several browser tabs are visible, suggesting other websites the user has open. The title bar indicates "Remote Online Exam (TDS Jan 20...".

* **Exam Information:**  The main content displays the results of an exam.  Key information includes:
    * **Completion Time:** "Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST"
    * **Score:** "Score: 0" (although there's a record of a previous score of 10)
    * **Bonus Mark Opportunity:**  A section titled "Bonus mark" encourages students to fill out a form before a deadline for extra credit.  This section explicitly states it's for IITM (presumably an institute's) students only.
    * **Help/Support:** A box provides links for students with questions ("Join Discourse") or technical issues ("Join Google Meet"), again specifying IITM students only.
    * **Login Information:** The user's login email address (`2112000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) is visible, confirming the user's identity within the system. A logout button is present.
    * **Recent Saves:** A section shows the user's recent attempts and scores.  One attempt shows a score of 0, and another shows a score of 10.

* **Bottom Section:** A section titled "Questions" is visible, indicating potentially more parts of the exam or additional information available.

* **Taskbar:** The Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom of the screenshot, showing various applications and icons.

Overall, the image depicts the end of an online exam, showing the results and providing links for help or extra credit opportunities. The restricted access to the bonus mark and support links clearly indicate a controlled environment for specific students.

Hello @carlton / @Saransh\_Saini

I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.  

image940×568 36.4 KB

I understand I should have submitted more frequently, but those final 5 minutes flew by like the fastest 5 minutes of my life.

Please consider accepting my submission

Thanks so much and best regards,
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed screen capture, likely from a web application or software. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Section:** The top section displays a login message: "You are logged in as 22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."  Below this is a red "Logout" button.

* **Middle Section (Large Gap):** A significant amount of empty space separates the top and bottom sections.

* **Bottom Section:** This section has a dark green background and contains the text "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)". Underneath this heading are two entries showing recent saves:

    * **Entry 1:** A blue "Reload" button next to "from 3/2/2025, 3:16:50 AM. Score: 8"
    * **Entry 2:** Another blue "Reload" button next to "from 3/2/2025, 3:15:46 AM. Score: 8"

**Overall:** The image suggests a user interface related to a game, quiz, or any application that keeps track of scores and allows users to reload previous attempts.  The email address suggests a possible academic or institutional context.

The image shows a terminal window displaying the output of a Python script that uses the `tabula-py` library to extract tables from a PDF file.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section (Requirement Satisfaction):**

This part shows that the script successfully installed and verified the necessary Python packages for its operation.  The packages include `tabula-py`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `distro`, `python-dateutil`, `pytz`, `tzdata`, and `six`.  Each line indicates that the requirement was already satisfied, along with the version and location of the package.

**Middle Section (PDF Processing):**

This section shows the progress and results of the PDF processing:

* **File Selection:** The user selected a PDF file named `q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2).pdf`.
* **Processing Progress:** The script displays the size of the PDF file (167477 bytes) and indicates that the extraction was 100% complete.
* **Output File:** The extracted data was saved to a new file: `q-extract-tables-from-pdf (2) (1).pdf`.
* **Warnings:** Several warnings regarding fallback fonts (`Liberationsans` for `Symbol` and `ZapfDingbats`) indicate that the script encountered issues rendering certain fonts within the PDF. This is a common occurrence when dealing with PDFs and various font types.

**Bottom Section (Extracted Data and Data Types):**

This displays the extracted tabular data as a Pandas DataFrame.  It includes numerical data from a table with columns for "Maths," "Physics," "English," "Economics," "Biology," and "Group." Rows are numbered 0-4.

Below the numerical data, the script shows the data type of each column as `int64`, indicating that the values are 64-bit integers.  Finally, it gives the `dtype: object` which describes the overall data type of the dataframe, and a seemingly unrelated number `34919`.


**Overall:**

The image captures a complete process, from dependency checking to PDF extraction and data display.  The warnings about fallback fonts don't appear to have negatively impacted the extraction of numerical values.  The final output shows a nicely formatted table, ready for further analysis within Python.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screen capture of a multiple-choice question and answer interface.  The question asks: "What is the total Biology marks of students who scored 30 or more marks in Maths in groups 1-28 (including both groups)?"

A text box is provided for the answer. The user has entered "34919", but this answer has been marked as incorrect with the message "Incorrect. Try again." displayed beneath the answer box.  The words "Biology" and "Maths" are highlighted in a pinkish-purple color. The number 30 is also highlighted in a similar color.  A small warning icon is visible next to the answer box.  The overall appearance suggests an online quiz or assessment platform.

The image shows a screenshot of an online exam or assessment platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** A green bar at the top displays the remaining time ("00:19:29 left"), the current score ("Score: 10/10"), and buttons to "Check all" and "Save" the answers.

* **Help/Support Section:** Below the top bar is a dark-colored section providing links for help:  "Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only)" and "Technical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)."  This suggests the exam is specifically for Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) students.

* **Login Information:**  It shows the user is logged in with the email address "21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" and a "Logout" button.

* **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves" displays three entries showing timestamps and scores from previous saves of the exam. This indicates the possibility of resuming the exam from the latest saved point.

* **Questions Section:** The main section of the image shows the start of the questions, beginning with "Questions" as a heading and the first question: "1. Write a FastAPI proxy server (1 mark)."

**Overall:** The image depicts an online examination interface with a timer, score tracking, assistance resources, save functionality, and the first question of an exam focusing on building a FastAPI proxy server.  The exam appears to be specifically for IITM students.

Hello @carlton / @Saransh\_Saini

I am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.  
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.  
Could you please consider my request?  
Thank you.

Major betrayal - laptop, shut down like 5 times during the test losing 10 solid minutes, i think we should have atleast 1 hour from next term onwards
That's a digital illustration of a sad-faced emoticon, commonly known as an emoji. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a round, yellow circle. The yellow is a bright, slightly golden hue.

* **Facial Features:** The emoji has two small, dark brown or black dots for eyes, positioned relatively close together. Its mouth is a downward-curving, slightly thick, dark brown or black line, which clearly expresses sadness.  The mouth's curve is gentle, not overly exaggerated.

* **Style:** The style is simple and minimalist, typical of emoji design. The features are smoothly rendered without sharp lines or excessive detail. The overall look is friendly, albeit expressing a negative emotion.

* **Background:** The background is transparent, making it suitable for use on various backgrounds.

Sir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves.  
Thank you.
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying what appears to be the results page of an online exam or test. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** A browser address bar shows the URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe`.  Standard browser navigation buttons (back, forward, refresh) are also visible.

* **Result Summary:** A red banner displays the message "Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST" indicating the exam's completion time and location (IST likely refers to India Standard Time). Next to it, "Score: 0" shows the current score, and a button labeled "Check a" (likely "Check answer" or similar) is present.

* **Recent Saves:** A dark-green box displays a section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)".  Within this box, three lines show previous saved attempts:
    * Each line includes a blue "Reload" button, a timestamp (all on March 2nd, 2025, around 1:41 PM), and the score (all showing 10).  This implies the user has saved their progress multiple times before the final submission.

The overall appearance suggests a clean and simple interface, likely from a testing platform.  The discrepancy between the final score of 0 and the repeated saved scores of 10 indicates either a problem with the system or a misunderstanding of the scoring process.

Hi @23f2000778

No need to worry about that, I have checked in backend your score is 10 of 10.

Hi @21f3002158

I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.

Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.

There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.

Kind regards

@carlton @Jivraj sir, I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that  
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process

Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity

The image shows a screenshot of a web page, likely an online exam or assessment platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Header:** The top shows a URL (`https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe`), indicating a specific exam or test.  The time and date ("Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST") display when the exam concluded. A score of "9/10" is prominently shown along with "Check all" and "Save" buttons.

* **Instructions:** Below the header, instructions are given:  "Please fill out this form before 5 pm IST to get a bonus mark. Details of the bonus are in the form description. (This is for IITM students only.)" This implies a bonus opportunity for students who complete a form.

* **Help/Support:** A dark teal box provides help resources: "Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only)" and "Technical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)". This suggests Discourse and Google Meet are provided for support.

* **Login Status:** The user is identified as logged in as "24f2003130@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," likely a student email address from IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras). A "Logout" button is available.

* **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" shows three entries, each indicating a time stamp, and a score of 9, presumably representing saved attempts at the exam.  There's a "Reload" button next to each entry.

* **Browser Interface:** Standard browser elements like the address bar, back and forward buttons, a refresh button, etc. are visible at the very top.

In summary, the image is a post-exam summary page, showing the exam's completion, a student's score, instructions for a bonus, and support channels.  The information strongly suggests an academic context, specific to IITM students.

The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful

Ok sir  
Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28  
I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches.

Thank you

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

The image shows a screenshot of an online exam or quiz interface. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Bar:** Shows a timer (00:04:19 left), the current score (1/10), a "Save" button, and an additional button (likely for navigation or settings).  The background is dark green.

* **Question:** The main question asks to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between columns A and B.  A text box is provided for the answer.

* **Instructions:** Below the question box, detailed instructions explain how to calculate the coefficient (using Python, Excel, or JavaScript), emphasizing that there are no missing values and that the answer should be rounded to 3 decimal places.  A "Check" button allows for submission.

* **Error Message:** A large red error box at the bottom displays "Error!" and "Failed to fetch," followed by a request to contact the exam team for assistance.

* **Save Reminder:** A small message at the very bottom encourages saving regularly, assuring that the last saved submission will be evaluated.

The overall appearance suggests a timed, online assessment where students are asked to perform a statistical calculation. The "Failed to fetch" error suggests a problem with the system, preventing the submission from being processed.

Hi @23f2004781

I looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission.

23f2004781:

> There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive.

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline.

image1130×240 10.2 KB

Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.
That's a digital image of a single capital letter “D” on a solid purple background. 


Here's a breakdown of the visual details:

* **Letter:** The "D" is white or light-colored, appearing sans-serif and relatively simple in its font style. It's centered within the image.

* **Background:** The background is a uniform, medium-toned purple.

* **Size and Shape:** The image is square, and the letter occupies a significant portion of the space.  The overall dimensions are small, typical of a profile picture or icon size.

The image is simple and clean, lacking any other details or elements beyond the letter and the background color.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a rectangular box, which appears to be an informational message or callout, set against a dark teal/dark blue background.  The box itself has a bright cyan border. 


Within the box, there are two lines of text in a lighter cyan color. Both lines start with a question and offer a solution, specifically targeting IITM (presumably Indian Institute of Technology Madras) students:

* **Line 1:** "Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only)" - This suggests a forum or discussion board called "Discourse" is available for general inquiries.

* **Line 2:** "Technical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)" - This indicates that for technical problems, students can optionally join a Google Meet session for assistance.  The word "OPTIONAL" is capitalized, suggesting it's not mandatory.

To the left of the text is a small icon resembling a speech bubble with three horizontal lines inside, commonly used to represent a chat or message.

The overall impression is that this is a helpful message providing support channels for IITM students.

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.

Hi @Jayeshbansal

Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.

I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

Kind regards

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

Hi @Jayeshbansal

After deadline we gave allowance for 2 minutes considering network issues students might have faced, so till 1:47:00 all submissions will be considered valid, after that we won’t take any submissions.

Following are your submissions all of them were after deadline

Hello sir, @Jivraj  
Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then?

Yes, it won’t be considered.

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

Sorry @Jayeshbansal All your submissions were around 7 hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation.

Kind regards

Hi @23f3002537  
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

```

Hello @Jivraj sir,

Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.

I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.

Please re consider this request sir.

@Jivraj Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573.

I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.  
Regards

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).

Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.

I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.

Please reconsider if possible.

Thanks

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.

Respected Sir,

I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.

Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.

Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.

Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted  
rollnumber 23f2001390

Screenshot 2025-03-09 at 2.42.50 pm1914×194 12.2 KB

The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered.
Here's a description of the image content:

The image shows a table-like structure with two rows of data.  Each row contains three data points:

* **Column 1:**  An email address, partially obscured but showing the pattern "23f20013900@ds.study.iitmn.ac.in".  The only difference between the two rows is the first few digits of the numerical portion of the email address.

* **Column 2:** A timestamp indicating date and time, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".  The dates are identical in both rows (2025-03-02), but the times differ.

* **Column 3:** A numerical value, "4" in the first row and "3" in the second row.

The structure is consistent with a log file or a database table extract, possibly showing email activity or events linked to these addresses and timestamps. The numerical value in the third column might represent a count of some kind, an identifier, or some other relevant metric.
