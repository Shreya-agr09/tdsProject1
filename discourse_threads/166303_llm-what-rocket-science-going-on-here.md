Hi Hari,

The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.

Have you watched this session in particular?

If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it

followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases

But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.

Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

Kind regards
Here's a description of the image:

The image is a digital graphic announcing "Week 3 Session 1". 


Here's a breakdown of its elements:

* **Background:** The background is a muted peach or light orange color.

* **Central Feature:** A large, square, off-white box in the center is filled with a dense collection of small, colorful, stylized icons representing various data visualizations and technology elements (charts, graphs, diagrams, mobile devices, pencils, etc.). The style is modern and flat.

* **Text Overlay:** A dark blue rectangular banner spans the middle, overlaying the central graphic. Within this banner, "WEEK 3" is prominently displayed above "SESSION 1". Both lines of text are large, white, and easily readable.  The font is sans-serif and bold.

* **Overall Impression:** The design is visually busy but organized, suggesting a structured learning or presentation environment. The combination of colorful data-related icons and the clear session announcement creates an impression of a course or workshop segment.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a split screen.  The larger portion displays a Google Chrome browser window on a Windows operating system. The browser is open to a webpage with a vibrant orange background featuring a stylized anime character (Naruto Uzumaki) in the center.  Overlaid on the orange background are several square icons, each representing a different link or application, including items like "TDS Discourse", "App Dev II Project Doc...", "Java Tutorial," and several others.  The titles are partially obscured by the anime character.  Below the icons are more, including  "PDSA" and "MAD-2 resources". The Chrome address bar shows the user is likely logged into Google Meet and is searching for information on "large language models".

The smaller portion of the split screen is a dark background with a simple white logo (resembling a stylized drop of water) and the text "Amit Kumar Gupta" underneath.  This suggests a video conferencing or online meeting application, with Amit Kumar Gupta's name likely representing the user or participant in the call.

The Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom, showing several application icons.  The system clock indicates the time is 20:14 (8:14 PM) on July 11th, 2024.  The overall appearance suggests a personal computer used for development or programming-related tasks, given the content of the links on the webpage.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a laptop screen displaying an online course module on data sourcing. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** A standard Chrome browser window is visible at the top, showing various tabs including Google services, a course platform, and communication tools like Gmail and ChatGPT.  The URL indicates an online course from IIT Madras.

* **Course Navigation:** On the left, a sidebar displays the course structure, with sections like "Course Introduction," "Self Assessment," "Data Discovery," "Data Sourcing," "Data Preparation," "Data Analysis," "Large Language Models," and "Project 1 & 2." The "Data Sourcing" section is currently expanded.

* **Data Sourcing Module:** The main part of the screen shows the content of the "Data Sourcing" module.  This includes:
    * A star rating and reviews for the module.
    * A description outlining the control extraction and data saving processes involved in data sourcing.
    * Links and references to resources like a PDF scraping notebook and information about the Tabula and Pandas packages (with a link to a video).
    * A section labeled "Optional: Real-life scraping" that describes a scenario where data was scraped from emarketer.com, showcasing a realistic example of web scraping.  A video of this process is embedded below the text.

* **Dock:** The bottom of the screen displays the macOS dock, showing various applications including Safari, Chrome, a terminal application, and others.

* **Video Conference:**  A small video conference window (possibly Zoom or similar) shows a person, Carlton D'Silva, which is also shown as a profile picture in the bottom right.


In short, the image captures a student or educator engaged in an online course focused on data sourcing techniques, emphasizing practical application through a real-world scraping example.
