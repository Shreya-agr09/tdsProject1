Hi @carlton,  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text and structure to help answer questions:

**Overall Structure:**

The image shows a spreadsheet-like view, likely from a program like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.  There are two distinct sections, each representing a dataset or a series of metadata.

**First Section (Rows 1-8):**

*   **Row 1:** The first row is labeled **PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, not seasonally adjusted**
*   **Row 2:** Labeled **Series Title**
*   **Row 3:** Labeled **Series ID:** The corresponding value in column B is **PCU3254123254127111**
*   **Row 4:** Labeled **Seasonality:** The corresponding value is **Not Seasonally Adjusted**.
*   **Row 5:** Labeled **Survey Name:** The corresponding value is **PPI Industry Data**.
*   **Row 6:** Labeled **Measure Data:** The corresponding value is **Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations**.
*   **Row 7:** Labeled **Industry:** The corresponding value is **Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing**.
*   **Row 8:** Labeled **Item:** The corresponding value is **Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations**.

**Second Section (Rows 10-17):**

*   **Row 10:** The first row is labeled **PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Calcium channel blockers, not seasonally adjusted**
*   **Row 11:** Labeled **Series Title**
*   **Row 12:** Labeled **Series ID:** The corresponding value in column B is **PCU3254123254127114**
*   **Row 13:** Labeled **Seasonality:** The corresponding value is **Not Seasonally Adjusted**.
*   **Row 14:** Labeled **Survey Name:** The corresponding value is **PPI Industry Data**.
*   **Row 15:** Labeled **Measure Data:** The corresponding value is **Calcium channel blockers**.
*   **Row 16:** Labeled **Industry:** The corresponding value is **Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing**.
*   **Row 17:** Labeled **Item:** The corresponding value is **Calcium channel blockers**.

**Key Observations:**

*   The data appears to be related to Producer Price Index (PPI) data for the pharmaceutical industry.
*   There are details for two different categories of preparations/blockers: "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations" and "Calcium channel blockers".
*   The data includes a Series ID, Seasonality (specifically, "Not Seasonally Adjusted"), Survey Name, Measure Data, Industry, and Item.
*   Each record has a title that contains information about the industry and preparation or blocker.

This detailed description should enable you to answer specific questions about the image content.

Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a question from an online assignment or quiz, specifically labeled "Question 7.1." The question pertains to data analysis using CSV files and Google Sheets.

**Text Content:**

*   **Question Title:** "Question 7.1"
*   **Scenario:**
    *   A fictional political party, "Buddhi Daya Nyaay (BDN)," wants to analyze the impact of pharmaceutical exports from India to the US on the Indian economy.
    *   Data is provided stating that India's pharmaceutical exports to the United States for FY 2024 reached ₹2,42,888 Crores.
    *   The user is tasked with creating an insightful analysis using provided CSV files.
*   **Provided Files:**
    *   "Industry Product Segment Information"
    *   "Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)"
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Create a new blank Google Sheet workbook named "ga.7.1.rollno" (where "rollno" is replaced with the user's IITM roll number without the domain).
    2.  Share the Google Sheet with editing rights to "se2002@study.iitm.ac.in."
    3.  "NOTE: Make sure the sheet names are exactly as given below"
    4.  Rename "Sheet1" with the columns "Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value."
    5.  Rename "Sheet2" to "Create a pivot table with Item as rows, Year and Month as columns following the same hierarchy stack and Value as values."

**Important Considerations:**

*   The roll number extraction and file naming convention are critical.
*   Sharing permissions are explicitly required for grading.
*   Sheet naming and column order are important to follow.
*   The pivot table structure is crucial for the analysis.

In summary, the image presents a data analysis assignment involving pharmaceutical exports, requiring the user to create and share a Google Sheet with specific data and pivot table configurations based on provided CSV files.

@Jivraj

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”
The image shows the text "4. Sheet1: Columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value." The text describes the structure of a spreadsheet named "Sheet1," indicating it contains columns with the headings "Series ID," "Item," "Year," "Month," and "Value." The text is formatted in a way that suggests it's a description or specification point, possibly from a document or set of instructions. The number "4" suggests it could be a numbered list item.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

The image shows a snippet of a spreadsheet. It displays a table with the following column headers:

*   **Series ID:** In the first row, the value is "PCU3254-3254-".
*   **Year:** The first row indicates the year "2023".
*   **Period:**  The first row indicates the period "M01".
*   **Label:** The first row displays the label "2023 Jan".
*   **Value:** The first row indicates a numerical value of "562.445".

The text and arrangement suggest the data represents time-series information, likely economic or statistical data, with values recorded for different periods within a specific year.

Below items don’t have prices.

| PCU3254123254127111 | Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations |
| --- | --- |
| PCU3254123254127114 | Calcium channel blockers |
| PCU325412325412MM | Miscellaneous receipts |
| PCU325412325412D112OC | Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter |
| PCU325412325412D113 | Antacids |
| PCU325412325412SS | Secondary products |
| PCU3254123254127112 | ACE inhibitors |

Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

> Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

@carlton @Jivraj
Here's a breakdown of the image content to help you with questions:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image shows a spreadsheet or table.
*   It appears to be related to financial data, specifically tracking the "SUM of Value" for various "Items" (likely pharmaceutical products).
*   The data is organized by "Year" and "Month." 2023 and Months 01-05 are visible.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Columns:**
    *   **Column A ("Item"):** Lists various pharmaceutical product categories (e.g., "ACE inhibitors," "Analgesics," "Antacids").
    *   **Column B ("Year"):**  Appears to have a general placeholder (likely needs to be filled with the year value).
    *   **Column C ("Month - Total"):** Shows total values for each item, which looks like its adding the months.
    *   **Columns D - H:**  Represent the months of January-May ("M01," "M02," "M03," "M04," "M05") within the year 2023. Each cell shows a numerical value, presumably the sum of value for that item in that specific month.

**Specific Data Points:**

*   **ACE Inhibitors:** The line item "ACE inhibitors" (row 4) has a total value of 0 in Column B and C. The sheet lists the numbers for months 1 through 5.
*   **Antacids:** The line item "Antacids" (row 8) has a total value of 0 in Column B and C.

**Important Text:**

*   "SUM of Value" (A1): Indicates the data being tracked is a sum of some kind.
*   "Item" (A3): Column header for product categories.
*   "Year" (B2): Column header for the year.
*   "Month" (C2): Column header for the month.
*   "Total" (C3): Specifies column C is for totals.

**Observations:**

*   Some items have values filled in for all months of 2023 (M01-M05), while others have "0."
*   The spreadsheet seems to be in the process of being populated or updated.

Let me know if you have any specific questions about the image's content!

Hi @carlton,  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?  

image1393×657 67.8 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text and relevant features:

**Overall Structure:**

The image depicts a portion of a spreadsheet, likely from software like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. The visible section includes columns A through J and rows containing data. The spreadsheet presents data related to the Producer Price Index (PPI) for the pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing industry. The data seems to be organized in a structured, tabular format.  There are two distinct sets of data, separated by a blank row, each describing a different item within the pharmaceutical industry.

**Data Fields and Values:**

Each data set contains several fields, identified by descriptive labels in column A. These include:

*   **Series Title:**  A description of the data set (e.g., "PPI industry data for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, not seasonally adjusted").

*   **Series ID:** A unique identifier code (e.g., "PCU3254123254127111").

*   **Seasonality:** An indicator of whether the data is seasonally adjusted (e.g., "Not Seasonally Adjusted").

*   **Survey Name:**  The name of the survey from which the data is derived (e.g., "PPI Industry Data").

*   **Measure Data:** The specific item or type of product being measured (e.g., "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations").

*   **Industry:**  The type of industry the data relates to (e.g., "Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing").

*   **Item:** Similar to 'Measure Data', describing the item (e.g., "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations").

**Specific Data Instances:**

There are two primary instances of data:

1.  **Anticoagulants, Hemostatics, and Digitalis Preparations:** This section describes data related to this specific category of pharmaceutical products.  The series ID is PCU3254123254127111, and it is "Not Seasonally Adjusted."

2.  **Calcium Channel Blockers:** This section details data concerning "Calcium channel blockers".  The series ID is PCU3254123254127114, and it is also "Not Seasonally Adjusted."

**Text and Formatting:**

*   The text is clear and readable.
*   The formatting is basic, typical of a spreadsheet.
*   The text in some cells (e.g., Series Title) extends beyond the cell width, overlapping into adjacent columns.

**In summary, the image presents structured spreadsheet data relating to Producer Price Indices for specific pharmaceutical preparations, including details about the series, seasonality, survey source, and item being measured.**

Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

The image displays a question from a form, likely an assignment or assessment.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Question Title:** "Question 7.1"
*   **Scenario:** Describes a situation where a political party (Buddhi Daya Nyaay - BDN) wants to analyze the impact of pharmaceutical exports from India to the US on the Indian economy. It mentions that India's pharmaceutical exports to the US reached ₹2,42,888 Crores for FY 2024. The user is tasked with creating an insightful analysis using provided CSV files.
*   **Provided Files:** Lists two files:
    *   Industry Product Segment Information
    *   Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)
*   **Tasks:** Specifies the tasks the user needs to perform:
    1.  Create a new blank Google Sheet workbook named "ga.7.1.rollno," replacing "rollno" with the IITM roll number (excluding the domain).
    2.  Share the workbook with editing rights to "se2002@study.iitm.ac.in." It emphasizes that failing to share from a blank workbook will result in rejection.
    3.  **NOTE:** Highlights the importance of using the exact sheet names.
    4.  **Sheet1:** Specifies that the first sheet should have the columns "Series ID," "Item," "Year," "Month," and "Value."
    5.  **Sheet2:** Instructs the user to create a pivot table on the second sheet with "Item" as rows, "Year" and "Month" as columns (in a hierarchical stack), and "Value" as values.
*   **Top of the Image:** A statement saying "Your email will be recorded when you submit this form".

In essence, the image presents a scenario and specific data analysis tasks to be performed using provided files and a Google Sheet. The instructions emphasize correct file naming, sharing, and sheet structure.

@Jivraj

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”
The image displays the text "4. Sheet1: Columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value." The text indicates that the columns in a sheet named "Sheet1" contain the following data: Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. The numbers are most likely numbering the sheets of an excel, with number 4 referencing sheet number 4.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image shows a snippet of a spreadsheet or table.
*   It appears to be data organized in columns and rows.

**Columns:**

*   **A: Series ID:**  Contains codes like "PCU3254-3254-". This seems like a unique identifier for a particular data series.
*   **B: Year:**  Indicates the year, with examples showing "2023".
*   **C: Period:** Represents the time period within the year, using a notation like "M01" (likely representing January).
*   **D: Label:** Provides a textual description of the period (e.g., "2023 Jan").
*   **E: Value:** Contains numerical data, such as "562.445".

**Data Rows:**

*   **Row 2:** Defines the column headers.
*   **Row 3:** Contains example data, relating to "PCU3254-3254-" series in January 2023, with a value of 562.445.
*   **Row 4:** Contains data for period “M02” labeled “2003 Fak” and a value of “ECE 040”.

**In Summary:**

The image shows a dataset likely tracking some kind of value over time, with columns for the series identifier, year, period, label, and the actual value. It's structured in a way that allows tracking how the "Value" changes over different periods for a specific "Series ID".

Below items don’t have prices.

| PCU3254123254127111 | Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations |
| --- | --- |
| PCU3254123254127114 | Calcium channel blockers |
| PCU325412325412MM | Miscellaneous receipts |
| PCU325412325412D112OC | Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter |
| PCU325412325412D113 | Antacids |
| PCU325412325412SS | Secondary products |
| PCU3254123254127112 | ACE inhibitors |

Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

> Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image shows a spreadsheet, likely from a program like Google Sheets or Excel. The spreadsheet appears to contain information about the sales or value of different pharmaceutical items.

**Key Elements:**

1.  **Header Rows:**
    *   **Row 1:** Shows "SUM of Value"
    *   **Row 2:** Contains headers: "Year" (Column B), "Month" (Column C), Total (Column C), and specific month names for 2023 (Columns D to H).

2.  **Data Columns:**
    *   **Column A (Item):** Lists various pharmaceutical items such as "ACE inhibitors," "Analgesics," "Antacids," "Anti-acne preparations," and many others.
    *   **Column B (Year):** The heading is "Year."
    *   **Column C (Total):** Shows "0" values for some items like "ACE inhibitors" and "Antacids."
    *   **Columns D through at least H (Months of 2023):** Contains numerical data, presumably representing values for each item in each specific month of the year 2023.

3.  **Pharmaceutical Items:**
    *   The "Item" column (Column A) lists various categories of pharmaceuticals and related products.
    *   Examples include:
        *   ACE inhibitors
        *   Analgesics
        *   Antacids
        *   Anti-acne preparations
        *   Anticoagulants
        *   Antidepressants
        *   Antihistamines and bronchodilators
        *   Broad and medium spectrum antibiotics
        *   Calcium channel blockers
        *   Cancer therapy products
        *   Hormones and oral contraceptives
        *   Insulin/antidiabetes products
        *   Multivitamins

4.  **Specific Data Points:**
    *   "ACE inhibitors" has "0" for the total in column C and values from M01 to M05.
    *   "Antacids" has "0" for the total in column C and values from M01 to M05.
    *   "Analgesics" shows numerical data for the months M01 through M05 of 2023.

**Other Observations:**

*   The data seems to be numeric, suggesting sales figures, revenue, or some other quantifiable value.
*   Some items have a value of "0" in the "Total" column, and values from M01 to M05.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on anything specific!

Hi Tanya,

Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.

Kind regards

The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

Hi @carlton sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

**Header Area:**
*   Gmail logo (M Gmail) is visible in the top left corner.
*   A search bar with the text "peer review" is present.
*   Search filters like "From," "Any time," "Has attachment," and "To" are available for refining the search.
*   "Advanced search" option is also present.
*   Standard Gmail controls like settings, help, notifications, and user profile (indicated by an "IIT Madras" icon) are visible on the right side.

**Email List:**
The inbox displays a list of emails. The following emails are particularly prominent in the screenshot:
1.  **First Email:**

    *   **Sender:** Google Forms 9
    *   **Subject:** TDS Jan 2025 - GA 7 Review - GA 7 Review.
    *   Content mentions something about what was received and editing response.
2.  **Second Email**

    *   **Timestamp:** Apr 1

**Other Elements:**

*   Basic Gmail interface elements like "Mail," "Conversations," "Spaces" are present.
*   Controls for refreshing, archiving, deleting, and marking as read are also visible.
*   The text "1-29 of 29" suggests that there are 29 emails related to the search term.
*   Navigation arrows "<" and ">" are present to move through the email list.

In summary, the image is a Gmail screenshot showcasing emails related to "peer review," specifically focusing on emails from "Google Forms" and "22t1 se2002" regarding submissions, scores, and peer evaluations with attached HTML files.

Hi Shambhavi, Thanks for the update. We will look into it.

Thanks once again

Sir,  
In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest **and** yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.  
Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

@carlton  
sir can you please clarify what do we have to write in google form if there is no submission?

You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
