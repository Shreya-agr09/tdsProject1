@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like

* Is the GitHub repo public?
* Does it have an MIT license?
* Does it have a DockerFile?
* Is the Docker image accessible?

Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile.  
I have renamed the ‘LICENSE’ file as ‘MIT LICENSE’.
The image contains two lines of text. The first line says: "No such repo; No 'MIT' in LICENSE; No Dockerfile". The second line says: "Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring."

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.

Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.

Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.

Warm Regards,

Here is a description of the image in detail:

The image is a screenshot of a file explorer or version control interface, likely from a code repository like GitHub or GitLab. It displays a list of files and folders with associated details like the commit message (or action performed) and the date of the last change. The theme is dark mode.

Here's a breakdown of the contents:

*   **Folders:**

    *   Business
    *   Operations
    *   app
*   **Files:**

    *   Dockerfile
    *   LICENSE
    *   README.md
*   **Commit Messages/Actions:**

    *   Reconfigured taskB8 taskB9 taskB10
    *   Reconfigured taskA8 taskA9 taskA10
    *   Updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt
    *   Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile
    *   MIT License
    *   Project Structure
*   **Dates/Times:**

    *   2 days ago (for Business, Operations, and app)
    *   yesterday (for Dockerfile)
    *   3 days ago (for LICENSE and README.md)

The interface appears to be well-organized, providing a clear overview of the project's structure and recent activity. There are icons to the right of the date/time column which appear to be related to different features such as (scales), (chart), (star), (eye), and (branches). There is also a "Re" displayed in the far right.

Here's a description of the image's content:

The image contains two lines of text. The first line states: "No such repo; No "MIT" in LICENSE; No Dockerfile." This suggests that certain files or repositories are missing or do not meet specific criteria (such as having an "MIT" license or a Dockerfile).

The second line says: "Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring."  This implies that a checklist exists, and a submission must meet the criteria on the checklist to be evaluated.

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a snippet from a file explorer or code repository interface, showing a list of files and folders. The interface has a dark theme.

**Folders:**

*   **Business:** A folder named "Business". The modification details state that it was "Reconfigured taskB8 taskB9 taskB10" and the last modification date was "2 days ago".
*   **Operations:** A folder named "Operations". The modification details state that it was "Reconfigured taskA8 taskA9 taskA10" and the last modification date was "2 days ago".
*   **app:** A folder named "app". The modification details state that it was "Updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt" and the last modification date was "2 days ago".

**Files:**

*   **Dockerfile:** A file named "Dockerfile". The modification details state that it was "Rename dockerfile to Dockerfile" and the last modification date was "yesterday".
*   **LICENSE:** A file named "LICENSE". The modification details state that it was "MIT License" and the last modification date was "3 days ago".
*   **README.md:** A file named "README.md". The modification details state that it was "Project Structure" and the last modification date was "3 days ago".

**General observations**
*The files and folders are arranged in a list, with icons to indicate their type (folder or file).
*To the far right are icons, these look to be common actions.
*The files and folders seem to be organized chronologically, based on the last modification date.
