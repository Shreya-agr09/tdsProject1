Dear all,

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the \*Tools in Data Science \* course: **LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator**. This is the basic prototype.

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.

A heartfelt thanks to **@s.anand**, our course instructor, and TAs **@Carlton** and **@Jivraj**, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.

I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

* Expand functionality and evaluation models.
* Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
* Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The GitHub repository is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!

Update: here is a video explaining the process - https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared  
Best regards,

Hi Avinash,

Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.

Kind regards

Thanks @carlton  I would definitely refine it.
That's an emoji! 


Specifically, it's a smiling emoticon with rosy cheeks. Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** A classic round yellow circle representing a face.

* **Eyes:** Two simple, slightly curved lines indicating closed eyes, suggesting contentment or shyness.

* **Mouth:** A gently curved line forms a simple, happy smile.

* **Cheeks:** Two small, light-pink circles on either side of the face, adding to the feeling of happiness and perhaps shyness or blushing.

* **Overall Impression:** The emoji conveys a feeling of pleasantness, happiness, and possibly shyness or warmth.  It's a very friendly and approachable image.

Thanks @carlton  I would definitely refine it.
That's an emoji! 


Specifically, it's a smiling emoticon with rosy cheeks. The emoji is a bright yellow circle representing a face. It has simple, curved lines forming a slightly upturned smile.  The eyes are also simple closed curves indicating happiness. There are two light-pink circles on the cheeks. The overall impression is one of shyness, contentment, or happiness.
