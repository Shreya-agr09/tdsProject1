### Technical Assessment

There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.  
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).  
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.

```
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

```

Do not submit or save your answers.

All the best!  
Kind regards  
TDS Team

### Update 2

### Shareable Online Calendar and Scheduling - Google Calendar

That's a small, pixelated version of the Google logo. 


Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

* **The Logo:** A stylized "G" in the Google colors (red, yellow, green, blue) is centered. The colors are slightly blurred or softened due to the low resolution.

* **The Circle:** The "G" is enclosed within a white circle, which has a slightly uneven, pixelated edge.

* **The Background:** The background is a muted, dark olive-green color.

The overall image quality is low; it's likely a very small icon or a low-resolution version of the Google logo.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image showcases Google Workspace's features through a visually appealing layout.  It depicts a modern, clean interface with a predominantly white background, accented with Google's signature blue. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Calendar and Schedule:** A monthly calendar displays, highlighting the 22nd of the month.  A weekly view is also shown, integrating event cards directly into the schedule. Events include things like “Follow up,” “Team meeting,” “Finalize presentation,” "Submit reimbursements," and “Focus time.”  Time slots are clearly indicated for each. The “Team meeting” event prominently features a “Join with Google Meet” button and a list of attendees.

* **Video Conferencing:** A video call is shown in a separate box, featuring a person participating in a video conference. It demonstrates Google Meet's video conferencing capabilities. The video call has basic controls visible, such as mute and camera options.

* **Task Management/Collaboration:** The image illustrates task management and collaboration features.  The "Follow up" task has a checkbox to indicate completion.  Another task appears related to expenses and a pitch deck, suggesting integrations with other Google Workspace apps. 


* **Branding:** The Google Workspace logo is prominently displayed at the bottom right.


The overall impression is that the image intends to demonstrate the integrated nature of Google Workspace, showcasing the ease of scheduling, video conferencing, task management and collaboration within a unified platform. The use of color and visual elements emphasizes user-friendliness and clarity.

@23f2003413

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

1. The chaos of ROE.
2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**
6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
8. How limited the time is.

The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.

Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).

I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Kind regards

Hello @carlton sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab

```
df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]

```

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957

using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

drive.google.com

### df\_gobindpur.csv

Google Drive file.

then i used margin formula as

```
margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100

```

using this i got answer for 1st question as

```
YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114

```

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software

That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.

That's a digital image showing a simple graphic consisting of a single, uppercase letter "S". 


Here's a breakdown of the image's features:

* **Letter:** A white sans-serif uppercase "S" is centrally positioned.  The typeface is clean and modern.

* **Background:** The background is a solid, deep blue.

* **Size and Placement:** The "S" takes up a significant portion of the image, leaving minimal space between the letter and the edges of the image.

The overall impression is a minimalist, possibly logo-like, graphic.  The color contrast between the white letter and the blue background makes the "S" easily visible.
 That's a close-up shot of a square icon featuring a white uppercase "S" on a solid blue background. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Shape:** The overall shape is a perfect square.
* **Background:** The background is a uniform, deep blue color.
* **Letter:** A single, sans-serif uppercase letter "S" is centered within the square. The letter is white, clean, and simple in its design.  There's no significant texture or shadowing on the letter.
* **Style:** The overall style is minimal and modern, likely representing a logo, app icon, or initials.

The image lacks any other details or elements besides the letter and the background.

@Jivraj @carlton  
“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?

That's a small, pixelated version of the Google logo. 


Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

* **The "G":** The iconic Google "G" is at the center, rendered in its characteristic colors: red, yellow, green, and blue.  The colors are slightly blurred or pixelated due to the image's low resolution.

* **The Circle:** The "G" sits inside a slightly off-white circle, which provides a background for the logo.  The circle itself is not perfectly smooth; its edges are a little jagged due to the low resolution.

* **The Background:** The background surrounding the circle is a muted dark olive green.

The overall effect is a small, somewhat blurry version of the familiar Google logo, possibly a favicon or a very low-resolution representation of the brand.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image showcases Google Workspace's interface, highlighting its calendar and meeting features. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Left:** A calendar widget displays the month of January, with the 22nd highlighted (Wednesday). A small card next to it shows a "Follow up" task with a "Yes" selection.

* **Top Center:** A horizontal timeline view shows the days of the week (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri), with Wednesday (22nd) highlighted. 

* **Main Section:** This area is the core of the image, showing scheduled events on Wednesday.  The events include "Order stationery," "Follow up," "Submit reimbursements," "Finalize presentation," and a prominent "Team meeting" entry. The "Team meeting" event details include a "Join with Google Meet" button, indicating a video conference, and a list of three attendees represented by small profile icons.

* **Bottom Right:** The Google Workspace logo is clearly displayed.

* **Bottom Center:** Below the Team Meeting card are options for Expenses and Pitch Deck, along with "Going?" and Yes/No/Maybe response buttons.

* **Bottom Left:** A video call window appears, showing a person in a video conference. The controls for muting, camera, and screen sharing are visible at the bottom of the video window.

The overall design is clean and modern, typical of Google's aesthetic. The image demonstrates Google Workspace's ability to integrate scheduling, calendar functions, and video conferencing seamlessly. The various elements work together to depict a user's day, highlighting task management, team collaboration, and communication.

After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult.

dear @carlton  
when will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/14](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/mock-roe-1-2-3-4-tds-jan-2025/168449/14)

@23f2003413

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

1. The chaos of ROE.
2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**
6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
8. How limited the time is.

The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.

Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).

I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Kind regards

Hello @carlton sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab

```
df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]

```

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957

using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

drive.google.com

### df\_gobindpur.csv

Google Drive file.

then i used margin formula as

```
margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100

```

using this i got answer for 1st question as

```
YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114

```

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

shubhamatkal:

> ```
> df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]

For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software

shubhamatkal:

> which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64

That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.  
Kind regards.
That's an image of a simple icon or logo. 


Here's a description:

* **Background:** The background is a solid, deep blue.

* **Foreground:** The only element in the foreground is a capital letter "S".  The "S" is white, sans-serif, and relatively simple in design. It's centered within the blue square.

* **Overall:** The image is clean and minimalist, likely designed for digital use such as an app icon, website avatar, or social media profile picture.  The contrast between the white "S" and the blue background is high, making it easily visible.

* **Background:** The background is a solid, dark blue color.

* **Foreground:** The only element in the foreground is a capital letter "S".  The "S" is white or light-colored and sans-serif, meaning it lacks the small decorative flourishes at the ends of the strokes. The font is simple and clean.

* **Overall:** The image is minimalist and uncluttered. The contrast between the dark blue background and the white "S" makes the letter highly visible. It likely represents a brand, an initial, or a single-letter identifier of some kind.

@Jivraj @carlton  
“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?

Did you all not solve the ROE already?
That's an emoji depicting a yellow, cartoonish face in thought. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Face:** The main part is a round, bright yellow circle representing a face.  It's smooth and lacks any lines or texture except for the facial features.

* **Eyes:** Two small, dark brown circles are positioned slightly off-center, giving a slightly skeptical or thoughtful expression.

* **Eyebrows:** A single, slightly raised dark brown eyebrow arch above each eye, contributing to the pensive look.  The left eyebrow is slightly more pronounced.

* **Mouth:** A downturned, thin, dark brown line forms a slightly sad or concerned mouth.

* **Hand:** A small, yellow hand is shown to the lower left side of the face. It's stylized and simple, with a finger pointing towards the chin. The thumb is tucked against the side of the index finger.


The overall impression is one of contemplation, mild concern, or skepticism.  There is no text within the image itself.  The style is reminiscent of many modern emojis found online and in messaging apps.
 That's an emoji depicting a yellow face in thought. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Face:** The face is round and yellow, typical of many emoji designs.  It has slightly downturned, arched eyebrows suggesting contemplation or slight concern. The eyes are dark brown and small, also contributing to the thoughtful expression. The mouth is a thin, slightly downturned line.

* **Hand Gesture:** A small yellow hand is visible at the bottom left, with the index finger touching the cheek, a classic gesture of thinking or pondering.

* **Overall Impression:** The emoji conveys a feeling of thoughtful consideration, perhaps even slight skepticism or uncertainty. It's not overtly sad or angry, but rather suggests a pensive mood.  It's a common image used online to represent thinking or questioning something.

Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Face:** The main part is a round, bright yellow circle representing a face.  It has a slightly concerned or pensive expression.

* **Eyes:** Two dark brown, oval-shaped eyes are slightly angled, adding to the thoughtful look.

* **Eyebrow:** One slightly raised dark brown eyebrow contributes to the pensive expression.

* **Mouth:** A small, slightly downturned mouth line suggests contemplation or mild worry.

* **Hand:** A small yellow hand, suggesting a finger touching the cheek, is positioned near the face's left side (viewer's right). This gesture is a common visual cue for thoughtfulness.

The overall style is simplistic, similar to other commonly used emojis. The color palette is limited to primarily yellow and brown, keeping the design clean and easily understandable.  There's no text present.
 That's a digital emoticon, specifically a variation of the "thinking face" emoji. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a round, bright yellow circle representing a face.

* **Facial Features:** The face has two dark brown, slightly oval eyes positioned somewhat close together.  It has a slightly downturned mouth, suggesting contemplation or slight concern. One eyebrow is slightly raised, adding to the thoughtful expression.

* **Hand Gesture:** A small, yellow hand is shown touching the face near the chin, a common visual cue representing thought or contemplation. The hand is simplified, with only basic finger details.

* **Style:** The style is cartoonish and simple, typical of emojis used in digital communication. The lines are somewhat pixelated or blocky, a common characteristic of emoji designs.

* **Overall Impression:** The emoji conveys a sense of thoughtful consideration, perhaps even mild skepticism or uncertainty.  The slightly downturned mouth and raised eyebrow contribute to this interpretation.
 That's a digital illustration of a yellow emoticon, specifically a variation of the "thinking face" emoji. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape and Color:** The main body is a bright yellow circle, representing the face.

* **Facial Features:** It has two dark brown, slightly oval-shaped eyes, positioned relatively close together. The eyebrows are subtly arched, one slightly more than the other, conveying a thoughtful or slightly suspicious expression. The mouth is a thin, slightly downturned line suggesting contemplation or mild concern.

* **Hand Gesture:** A small, yellow hand is shown touching the chin, a classic depiction of someone in thought.  The hand is stylized and simplified, not highly detailed.

* **Style:** The style is reminiscent of commonly used emojis or emoticons, with a pixelated or slightly rounded appearance. The lines are not perfectly smooth; there's a hint of a "blocky" quality to the image.

The overall impression is one of thoughtful consideration, perhaps even slight skepticism or uncertainty.  There is no text present in the image.
 That's an emoji depicting a smiling face with closed eyes. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** The emoji is a perfect or near-perfect circle.
* **Color:** The main color is a bright, sunny yellow.  There's a subtle gradient effect, possibly making the center slightly lighter than the edges, giving it a three-dimensional appearance.
* **Facial Features:**
    * **Eyes:** The eyes are completely closed, indicated by two gently curved, dark brown or black lines.  These lines are not perfectly horizontal; they have a slight upward curve at the ends.
    * **Mouth:** The mouth is a small, curved line, creating a subtle, contented smile. It's dark brown or black, similar in color to the eyes. It's a less expressive smile than a wide grin.

The overall impression is one of calmness, contentment, or peaceful relaxation.  The closed eyes suggest serenity or sleepiness.

Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price.

What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2 decimal places (e.g. 123.40).

```
!unzip /content/q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip -d /content/extracted_folder

```

```
import os
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup




total_sales = 0
html_folder = "/content/extracted_folder"  # Update if the folder name is different

for file in os.listdir(html_folder):
    if file.endswith(".html"):
        file_path = os.path.join(html_folder, file)

        # Step 3: Read the HTML content and extract tables
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f, "html.parser")
        
        tables = pd.read_html(str(soup))  # Extract all tables

        for table in tables:
            if {"Type", "Units", "Price"}.issubset(table.columns):
                # Step 4: Filter "Gold" ticket type and calculate total sales
                table["Type"] = table["Type"].str.strip().str.lower()
                gold_sales = table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Units"] * table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Price"]
                total_sales += gold_sales.sum()
# Step 5: Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places
print(f"Total Gold Ticket Sales: {total_sales:.2f}")

@all  
Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between `Doha` and `Muscat`.

World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the Haversine distance.

What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled?

Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas.

45 min up?  
  
Not even half WEW
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a red banner or notification bar displaying information about a quiz or test that has ended. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Main Text:** "Ended at Sun, 17 Nov, 2024, 2:00 pm IST" indicates the date and time the quiz concluded. IST likely stands for India Standard Time.

* **Score:** "Score: 6/12" shows the user's score—6 out of 12 possible points.

* **Buttons:** Two buttons are present:  "Check all" (likely to review all answers) and "Save" (likely to save the results). Both buttons are red with white text and a subtle white border.

* **Color Scheme:** The dominant color is a deep, slightly reddish pink. The buttons use the same red but stand out slightly more due to the white text and borders. The score box has a darker maroon color.

The overall appearance suggests a user interface element from an online quiz platform or learning management system.

We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home.   
Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it.

Kind regards
That's a winking emoji. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a circular yellow emoji, resembling a cartoon face. The yellow is a bright, slightly golden hue.

* **Facial Features:** The emoji has a closed eye on one side (the winking eye), indicated by a slightly curved line. The other eye is open and depicted with a simple dark brown circle and a small highlight. It has a simple, slightly curved smile rendered in dark brown. The eyebrows are short, slightly curved lines, also dark brown, conveying a playful expression.

* **Style:** The style is simple and consistent with commonly used emoji designs; the features are not highly detailed, but rather stylized and easily recognizable.

The image is clean and sharp against a black background.  There is no text present.

But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing.

I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me.

Kind regards

I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered.

But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this
That's an emoji! 


Specifically, it's a yellow circle-shaped emoticon with a wide, open-mouthed laugh, closed eyes that are slightly curved upwards, and a single drop of sweat on its right side (from the viewer's perspective). The emoji's expression suggests nervous or slightly anxious laughter—a joyful laugh tinged with a bit of unease.  The style is consistent with modern emoji designs, with smooth gradients and a glossy appearance. There's no text present.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screen capture of a Google Calendar event, specifically a "Live Session - TDS".  The event details are prominently displayed:

* **Event Title:** "Live Session - TDS"
* **Date and Time:** "Tuesday, 25 February 8:00 - 10:00pm" with a note that it's "Weekly on Tuesday, until 8 Apr 2025".
* **Meeting Link:** A button that says "Join with Google Meet" with a link underneath: "meet.google.com/odh-ycbm-ahj"
* **Phone Join Option:** Instructions for joining by phone are included, providing a US phone number and PIN.
* **Guest List:** A message stating that the guest list has been hidden at the organizer's request.
* **YouTube Playlist:** A link to a YouTube playlist related to the session is given.
* **Recurring Events:** Below the main event information, there are three buttons representing possibly recurring instances of the "Live Session" event.
* **Additional Information:**  "Jan 2025 - TDS" appears near the bottom, likely indicating other related events.  The creator's email address is listed at the very bottom: "se2002@study.iitm.ac.in".

The overall color scheme is dark, with the event details in light text.  There are icons for various functionalities at the beginning of each line, including those for video conferencing, phone, and a list. The top right corner has typical window controls: a small envelope icon (likely for email), a three-dot menu icon (for more options), and a close button (an "X").

Question 2 of the patent questions is missing, is it intentional?
The image contains a text-based problem statement divided into two questions, Q1 and Q2.  Both questions prompt the user to "Start coding or generate with AI," implying that the solution requires programming or a code-generation AI tool.

**Q1:** This question asks to analyze a dataset (not provided in the image) to identify the patent(s) with the highest number of claims. The output should be a comma-separated list of patent IDs, with no spaces between them.  The instructions also clarify how patent IDs are formatted in the dataset.  A sample patent ID is given: `US20230225250A1-20230720`.

**Q2:** This question is presented without any further instructions or context, only the prompt to "Start coding or generate with AI."  It suggests that a second task related to patents is expected but not specified in the image.

The overall appearance is a clean, simple layout with clear headings and instructions. The color scheme is primarily black text on a white background.  There's a dark gray horizontal separator between Q1 and Q2. The words "dataset" and "generate" are hyperlinked, though that functionality is not active in the image.

How many questions will we be having in our ROE?  
Because I remember Anand sir mentioning 17 questions in the explanation of the difficulty of the ROE

It completely depends on the ROE. There is just no reasonable way of knowing how many questions ROE will have. If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried.

I thought the mocks would be a representation of the actual ROE and the mocks had 6 questions so I assumed 6 questions.

Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks.

Respected @s.anand , @Jivraj , @carlton

Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.

As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.

I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.

Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Best Regards,  
Lakshay

“If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried”

Found this to be funny!
That's an emoji! 


Specifically, it's a cartoon-style emoticon depicting a face laughing so hard it's crying. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Face:** A round, yellow face forms the base. The yellow is a bright, cheerful shade.

* **Eyes:** Two small, slightly curved black lines represent closed eyes, typical of a laughing expression.

* **Mouth:** A wide, open mouth with a large, slightly uneven smile is featured. A small, pink tongue or lower lip is visible at the bottom of the mouth.

* **Tears:** Two light-blue teardrops stream down from the lower eyelids, indicating laughter so intense that it brings tears.

* **Style:** The emoji has a smooth, slightly glossy appearance, suggesting a modern, digital style.  The lines are somewhat softened, not sharply defined.

The overall impression is one of extreme, joyful laughter.
 That's an emoji depicting a face laughing so hard it's crying. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** The emoji is a round, yellow circle representing the face.

* **Eyes:** The eyes are simple, slightly curved lines suggesting happiness.

* **Mouth:** A wide, open mouth with a pronounced smile, indicating intense laughter. There's a pink tongue or inner mouth visible.

* **Tears:** Large, teardrop-shaped light-blue shapes stream down from the eyes, illustrating the uncontrollable laughter to the point of tears.

* **Style:** The style is typical of modern, glossy emojis commonly used in digital communication, with slightly shaded features to give it a 3D-like appearance.


The overall impression is one of joyful, unrestrained laughter.

Yeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download libraries. Colab provides more RAM but it frequently stops runtime and restarting it again is very time-consuming.

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini This is a question of GA 3. I tried AI hallucination, but was unsuccessful. Can you please tell what will be the appropriate prompt?
Here's a description of the image content:

The image shows a dark-themed webpage or interface, likely a challenge or task within a cybersecurity training program or assessment. 


The text explains that SecurePrompt Technologies, a cybersecurity firm, uses hardcoded instructions to prevent their large language models (LLMs) from outputting certain keywords.  The challenge is to find a prompt that tricks the LLM into violating this instruction and saying "Yes," which it's specifically programmed *not* to do.


Key elements include:

* **Explanatory Text:**  A significant portion is dedicated to explaining the context of the challenge: the company's security practices, the purpose of the exercise (testing LLM security and identifying vulnerabilities), and the goal of the task.

* **The Task:** The core instruction is clear: "Write a prompt that will get the LLM to say Yes."  It emphasizes the case-sensitivity of "Yes".  A text box is provided for the user to enter their prompt.

* **AI Proxy Token Mention:** The instructions mention using an "AI Proxy token" when prompted, suggesting an API or similar system is being used to interact with the LLM.

* **Warning:** A warning is given about submitting the answer and not changing it once a correct answer is obtained.

* **Success Condition:** The success condition is stated clearly: the LLM must output the exact word "Yes".

In short, the image presents a cybersecurity challenge focused on bypassing security restrictions in an LLM through prompt engineering. The user needs to craft a prompt that cleverly manipulates the model to say "Yes," despite explicit programming forbidding it.

Hi @23f1001231  
Here is a blog post made by Anand Sir Hacking an obnoxious, unhelpful LLM to say Yes - S Anand  
Give it a read, it would be helpful.

Hi,

I have started attempting the MOCKs, But I don’t know how to scrap the data from the link which is provided for MOCK 1.

I couldn’t find this in recorded sessions as well. Anyone please suggest a way to do it.

agreed, the time is very less  
we can solve all questions if time is increased, even a little

```
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point
import json

with open("regions.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

pickup_locations = [
    (6.488, -78.0287),
    (32.0198, -99.7243),
    (16.7257, -58.7811),
    (1.9307, 45.4928),
    (-34.6289, 133.0359)
]

cities = data["cities"]
regions = data["regions"]

matching_regions = []

for request_point in pickup_locations:
    point = Point(request_point)
    region_num = 1

    for region in regions:
        region_coordinates = [(cities[city][0], cities[city][1]) for city in region]
        region_polygon = Polygon(region_coordinates)

        if region_polygon.contains(point):
            matching_regions.append(str(region_num))
            break  # Stop checking once a match is found
        region_num += 1

print(",".join(matching_regions))

```

I have been trying this for the past 1 day and i still cant get the answer for mock roe 2, q5  
2 of my coordinates r not giving any value  
can someone please help

The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are.
That's a winking emoticon, a digital representation of a smiley face. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** It's a classic circle, representing a face.
* **Color:** The main color is a bright, sunny yellow.
* **Facial Features:**
    * **Eyes:** One eye is open and normally shaped, while the other is closed, showing a wink.  The open eye is detailed with a small, dark pupil.
    * **Mouth:** A slightly upturned curved line depicts a smile. It’s a simple, friendly-looking smile.
* **Style:** The style is simplistic and resembles the common emoji style found on many digital platforms.  The lines are not perfectly smooth; there's a slightly pixelated or "blocky" quality to the image, common in emoji designs.


The image is small but clearly depicts a cheerful and playful expression.
