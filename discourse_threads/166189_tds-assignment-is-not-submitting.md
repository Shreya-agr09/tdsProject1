Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

**The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.** Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.

As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.

Kind regards

Screenshot (313)1920×1080 243 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Context:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a web page related to an online graded assignment or exam.
*   It's likely hosted on a platform or learning management system (LMS).

**Header Area:**

*   **Title Bar:** Shows "Graded Assignment 3: BTM O," "TDS 2025 Jan GA3-Large Lang," and "Inbox (1,273)-233004066" as open tabs in the browser.
*   **URL Bar:** Displays the URL "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3," suggesting a development or testing environment.
*   **Alert Bar:**  A red bar at the top with the text: "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST Score: 0 Check all Save". This indicates the assignment's deadline has passed and shows the current score is 0.

**Important Instructions/Notes:**

*   **Key Instructions:** The image contains several important instructions:
    *   "Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser."
    *   "Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want."
    *   "It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed."
*   **Server Note:** "Note: You'll run multiple servers in this exam. All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers."

**User Information and Navigation:**

*   **Questions/Support:** A button or link labeled "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse" suggests a forum or communication channel for the exam.
*   **Login Information:**  "You are logged in as 23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." This shows the user's login ID/email address.
*   **Logout Link:**  A "Logout" link is present.

**Recent Saves:**

*   **"Recent saves" section:** Shows a list of recent save attempts, including the time and score.
    *   "Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:41 PM. Score: 8"
    *   "Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:37 PM. Score: 8"
    *   "Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:32 PM. Score: 8"

**Bottom of Screen:**

*   **Search Bar:** There is a windows search bar at the bottom.
*   **Date/Time:** The system's date and time are displayed as "04:39 07-02-2025"

**Implications and Key Takeaways:**

*   The exam is being conducted in a very open and flexible environment. Students are encouraged to use any resources they find helpful and are even allowed to attempt to hack the system.
*   The instructions about running multiple servers simultaneously suggest that some exam questions may involve interacting with or simulating server-side behavior.
*   The platform is being actively tested (development environment), and users may encounter browser-related issues.
*   The recent saves and scores give a sense of the progress and performance of the student.

Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image displays a user interface element, likely from a video game or application, listing "Recent Saves." It appears to be a menu or panel showing save game data and options.

**Text Elements:**

*   **"Recent saves"**: This is the title or header of the section.
*   **"Reload"**:  This word appears next to each save game entry within a blue button or outline. It likely represents an action button to load the corresponding save.
*   **Date and Time**: Each save game entry includes a date and time stamp in the format "2/2/2025, HH:MM:SS PM".  All the dates are the same, 2/2/2025, with different times in the PM.
*   **"Score: 4"**:  Each save game entry also includes a "Score" value of 4.  This suggests a game element or a metric associated with each save.

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Color Scheme**: The interface has a dark background, possibly a dark gray or black.  The text is primarily a light green color.  The "Reload" button or outline is a vibrant blue.
*   **Structure**: The content is structured as a list, with each save game entry presented in a similar format.
*   **List Items**: There are three save game entries displayed.

**Other Details:**

* A small red dot is next to the first "Reload" button.

**In summary, the image shows a listing of recent game saves, displaying the date/time of each save and the score at the time of the save. The "Reload" button next to each save allows the user to load that particular save point.**

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.  

Screenshot 2025-02-07 2013161859×960 88.4 KB

  
and the same happened for the 3rd assignment
Here's a detailed description of the image's content, focusing on the text, objects, and features relevant to understanding its purpose:

**Overall Context:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of an online quiz or examination interface. The text and layout indicate it's likely a web-based platform.

**Key Text Elements & their implications:**

*   **Header:** "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". This indicates a time limit or end date for the assessment. The "Score: 0" suggests the user hasn't answered questions yet or has a current score of zero. "Check all" and "Save" buttons are also visible.

*   **Instructions (Numbered List):** This section provides guidelines for the quiz. Key points include:
    *   Learning material is provided but optional.
    *   "Check" answers regularly to see if they're right.
    *   "Save" regularly; multiple saves are allowed, and the last one is evaluated.
    *   Reloading the page is okay.
    *   Browser issues might occur, suggesting trying a different browser or turning off security restrictions.
    *   "Use anything" - implying that resources like the Internet, ChatGPT, and libraries are allowed.
    *   "It's hackable" - explicit permission to hack the quiz for answers.

*   **Note:** Reinforces that multiple servers are running simultaneously.

*   **Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse** There is a link for questions

*   **User Information:** "You are logged in as 23f2000232@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." Shows the user's account and suggests this is a learning environment. "Logout" button available.

*   **Recent Saves:** Indicates the user has saved their progress multiple times. It lists timestamps and scores for each save, with "(most recent is your official score)" highlighted.

**Objects & Features:**

*   **Buttons:** Visible "Check all" and "Save" buttons in the top. Also "Reload" and "Logout" buttons

*   The layout is clean and designed for readability, focusing on providing clear instructions.

**In summary:**

The image depicts an online quiz interface with specific rules and advice. The platform encourages resourcefulness (using the internet, ChatGPT), even suggesting hacking is permissible. The recent saves section provides a record of progress. It's clear the quiz aims to test knowledge but is designed to allow creativity and problem-solving.

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as **4.25**, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored **7.25** shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image appears to be a screenshot of a graphical user interface (GUI) element, likely from a video game or application. The GUI element displays a section titled "Recent saves."  The main background of the GUI is a dark color, likely dark gray or black. The "Recent saves" section has a darker, green-tinted background, enclosed within a thin green border.

Within the "Recent saves" section, there are three entries, each representing a saved game or state.  Each entry is formatted as follows:

1.  **Reload:**  A blue button or link with the text "Reload." This suggests that clicking the button will load the corresponding save.
2.  **Date and Time:** The date and time the save was created, displayed in the format "2/2/2025, 9:04:XX PM." The timestamps are 9:04:58 PM, 9:04:53 PM, and 9:04:51 PM.
3.  **Score:** A score associated with the save, indicated by "Score: 4" in each entry. All three saves have a score of 4.

The text within the GUI is a lighter color, making it legible against the darker backgrounds.  The entries are stacked vertically, with the most recent save at the top. A red dot is present at the start of the save entry from 2/2/2025, 9:04:58 PM.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside the seek portal.

As stated in multiple places in discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission.

Kind regards

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.  

Screenshot 2025-02-07 2013161859×960 88.4 KB

  
and the same happened for the 3rd assignment
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**General Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an online quiz or examination interface. It has a dark theme with a red banner at the top and a green section at the bottom.

**Top Banner:**

*   **Text:** "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" - This indicates the deadline of the quiz or exam.
*   **Score:** "Score: 0" -  The current score is zero.
*   **Buttons:** "Check all" and "Save" - These are action buttons, likely to check all answers at once or save the current progress.
*  A small "X" in a red circle in the right corner - This is an indication that this window could be closed.

**Instructions/Information Section:**

This section contains a numbered list of instructions and information for the quiz-taker:

1.  **Learn what you need:** Encourages using provided materials or looking up answers.
2.  **Check answers regularly:** Explains the "Check" button functionality.
3.  **Save regularly:** Explains the "Save" button functionality.
4.  **Reloading is OK:**  Reassures the user that reloading the page is acceptable.
5.  **Browser may struggle:** Suggests troubleshooting steps for browser issues.
6.  **Use anything:** Explicitly allows the use of external resources like the Internet, ChatGPT, friends, etc.
7.  **It's hackable:**  States that hacking the quiz code is allowed.
*   **Note:** "You'll run multiple servers in this exam. All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers."

**Questions Section:**

* Have questions?: Join the discussion on Discourse

**User Information:**

*   **Text:** "You are logged in as 23f2000232@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." -  This shows the user's login ID or email.
*   **Button:** "Logout"

**Recent Saves Section:**

*   **Title:** "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"
*   **List of saves:** Displays a list of previous saves, including the date and time and the score at that save.  Examples include:
    *   "Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:29:19 PM. Score: 6"
    *   "Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:29:07 PM. Score: 6"
    *   "Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:00:34 PM. Score: 4.5"
* "Reload" Button for each save.

**Overall Impression:**

The image depicts a rather unusual online quiz environment where external resources and even hacking are explicitly permitted.  The interface seems designed to be flexible and forgiving, encouraging the quiz-taker to use all available resources.

Only 1st Graded assignment scores are visible on dashboard. I have submitted 2nd and 3rd GA before the deadline but still it showing “not submitted” on the seek portal…

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as **4.25**, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored **7.25** shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

Hi Satish,

Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.

Kind regards
