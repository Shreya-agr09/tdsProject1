    *   **Assessment (Due: 2 Feb 2025):** Indicates the due date for the assignment.
    *   **Not Submitted:** States that the assignment hasn't been submitted yet.

    A table structure is used to display scores:

*   The absence of scores in the "Your Score," "Peer Average," and "Median Score" columns indicates that the assignment hasn't been graded or scores haven't been released yet.
