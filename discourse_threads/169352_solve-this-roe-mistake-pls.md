can any one tell me why still it shows me that i miss exam although i pass it with 8.
The image shows a screenshot of a webpage, likely an online quiz or exam titled "TDS 2025 Jan ROE." 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Header:** The top shows a browser window with the quiz title and some tabs suggesting a course or educational setting.

* **Quiz Information:** The main section displays instructions for the quiz.  Key points include:

    * Students are allowed to use any resources (internet, ChatGPT, etc.).
    * They can check answers multiple times.
    * The quiz is "hackable" – students are encouraged to try finding answers by examining the code.
    * There's a bonus mark opportunity for completing a form by a deadline.

* **Progress/Score:** A small section near the top displays "Score: 8" indicating the user's current score.

* **Save Feature:** There's a feature allowing multiple saves of progress. The interface shows the timestamps of the most recent saves.

* **Technical Support:** A section offers links to Discourse (for questions) and Google Meet (for technical issues), both specifically for IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) students.

* **Login Information:** The user is identified by their IITM email address.

* **Browser Window:** Standard browser controls are visible at the top, along with the URL of the quiz.


The overall impression is that this is a unique quiz designed to test understanding and problem-solving skills, even encouraging unconventional approaches like code analysis. The use of multiple saves suggests a system designed for iterative learning and feedback. The bonus mark and support sections are focused on IITM students.

Did you submit before 1:47? If yes, then your highest score will be taken.  
If not then, you will be marked absent.
