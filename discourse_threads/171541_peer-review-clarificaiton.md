I am unable to open the files shared by the students I am peer reviewing as I don’t have access to them on my student email. Since we were asked to give access to se2002@study.iitm.ac.in when submitting, I wanted to check how this will work—will the team provide us access, or do we need to request it from the student and wait for them to grant it?"

Request access from the peer.

Also dont forget to give view permissions to your submissions.

Kind regards

I have completed my allotted 3 peer reviews, I was wondering if it’s possible to do more peer reviews for extra credit? I ask because all 3 of my allotted peer reviews were empty submissions and I don’t feel like I actually did any work
That's an emoji! 


Specifically, it's a cartoon-style yellow emoticon depicting a face with a wide, joyful grin, showing teeth and a pink tongue. The eyes are closed in happy squinting, and there's a single, light-blue drop of sweat next to the face, suggesting nervous or relieved laughter. The style is consistent with common emoji designs found in digital communication platforms.  There is no text.
