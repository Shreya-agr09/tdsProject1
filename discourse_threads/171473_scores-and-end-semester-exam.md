@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini

I have two queries.

1. Could you provide an ETA of GA6 score, GA7 score, final Project 1 score and Project 2 score?
2. I am uncertain about being able to attend the End Semester exam. In case I choose to take the end semester exam next term, will the project scores and ROE score be carried forward to the next term? I don’t know if the marking scheme will change next term or if the old marking scheme is followed for such cases.

Please let me know if possible.
