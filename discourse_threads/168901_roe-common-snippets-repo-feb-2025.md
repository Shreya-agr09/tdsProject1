I am too sleepy to work on it now… So seriously… PRs are not only appreciated but needed. Just add the basic parsing code or image manipulation for ga5. I will try and add in the morning but who doesn’t like Good PRs? Also mentioning @23f2005325 (Aishik) here for his wonderful PR which I have now merged.

This looks beautiful
The image shows a screenshot of a source control graph, likely from a Git repository management tool. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Bar:**  Shows "SOURCE CONTROL GR..." (likely a shortened name of the tool),  icons representing Auto, a circular target symbol, branch merging, downloading, uploading, and refresh. A downward-pointing arrow indicates that this is a collapsible section.

* **Main Area:** This section shows a visual representation of the commit history as a graph. Each colored circle represents a commit. The lines connecting them show the branches and merges. The branch `main` is explicitly labeled. The circles are colored differently, likely to represent different branches or contributors.  Each circle is associated with a commit message providing a brief description of the change.

* **Commit Messages:**  These are descriptions of what each commit included.  The messages include information about:
    * Merging pull requests (multiple instances)
    * Adding code (e.g., chardet for file encoding)
    * Renaming files (README)
    * Adding or modifying code related to specific projects or tasks ("Ilm code week-3")
    * Merging branches from remote repositories
    * Contributors signing off on changes
    * Adding website links
    * Adding API samples and data files

The graph visually displays the history of commits and branches. This is a common way to view the history of a project managed with a distributed version control system like Git.
 That's a digital image of a red heart. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a classic heart shape, slightly rounded and plump, not perfectly symmetrical. The color is a bright, slightly glossy red, suggesting a three-dimensional effect.  There's a subtle highlight near the top curves, giving it a sheen.

* **Style:** The style is simple and cartoonish. The edges are not perfectly smooth; rather, there's a slight pixelated or blocky quality, hinting at a digital origin or a low-resolution graphic. This isn't photorealistic; it's clearly a drawing or graphic design.

* **Background:** The background is transparent, which is common for icons or images intended to be overlaid onto other backgrounds.

In short, it's a simple, friendly-looking, pixel art-style red heart.

Failure is part of life. My laptop hanged and despite having all the needed resources I panicked and the exam went the way it went. I take this as a lesson. This resource will be refined further. I thank everyone involved. I am glad that many benefitted and were actually able to score well.

Thanks to the course team for giving us this idea of having snippets for common operations.
Here's a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository page. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Repository Name:** The main heading shows the repository name: `ritwiktrivedi/ROE-Master-Snippets-File`. This indicates the owner's username (`ritwiktrivedi`) and a descriptive name for the project (likely containing code snippets related to ROE, possibly Return on Equity).

* **Owner's Photo:** A headshot of the repository owner, Ritwik Trivedi, is displayed in a square image to the right. He appears to be a man with a beard and glasses, wearing a light-colored collared shirt.

* **Repository Statistics:** Below the repository name, key statistics are presented using icons:
    * `Contributors`: 4
    * `Issues`: 0
    * `Stars`: 2
    * `Forks`: 4

* **GitHub Icon:** The GitHub Octocat icon is present in the bottom right corner, further confirming the image's source.

* **Color Scheme:** The page features a predominantly white background with dark gray text and a vibrant orange banner at the very bottom.


In short, the image shows a GitHub repository overview, providing details about its name, owner, statistics, and a picture of the owner.  The low number of stars and forks suggests this is a relatively new or less widely known repository.

This looks beautiful
The image shows a screenshot of a source control graph, likely from a Git-based version control system.  The graph visually represents the history of commits and merges in a project.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Bar:** Shows the title "SOURCE CONTROL GR..." (truncated), indicating a source control graphical representation.  Next to it are icons suggesting auto-refresh, branching, merging, pulling, pushing, and a refresh button.  The "main" branch is highlighted.

* **Graph:** The main part of the image displays a linear graph with branches. Each circle on the line represents a commit. The colored lines between commits show merges and branches. Each circle is colored differently for visual distinction.

* **Commit Messages:** To the right of the graph, short descriptions of each commit are listed. These messages detail what changes were made in each commit.  Examples include merging pull requests, adding code, renaming files, and adding documentation.  Some commit messages include usernames or references to other repositories/branches.


The image effectively visualizes the commit history, providing a quick overview of the development process. The use of color-coding and concise commit messages makes it easily understandable.
 That's a digital image of a single, red heart. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a classic heart shape, slightly rounded and plump, not a sharp, geometric heart. The color is a bright, slightly glossy red, suggesting a three-dimensional effect.  There's a subtle highlight at the top that gives it a shiny look.

* **Style:** The style is simple and cartoonish.  The pixels are slightly visible, giving it a low-resolution, almost pixel-art aesthetic. It's not photorealistic; it's a simplified, easily recognizable representation of a heart.

* **Background:** The background is transparent; only the heart itself is visible.  This makes it suitable for use as an icon or graphic overlay.

There is no text or other objects present in the image, only the single red heart.
