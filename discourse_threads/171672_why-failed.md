on github you can clearly see i added mit license still it is showing failed
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image is a screenshot of a message or email, likely related to a course or project assignment. It's formatted as a notification of prerequisite evaluation results.

**Textual Content:**

*   **Salutation:** "Dear Learner," (appearing at the top)
*   **Project Introduction:** "Project 1 requires you to pass some pre-requisite checks as detailed on the TDS Project 1: Evaluation page." (followed by a hyperlink to "TDS Project 1: Evaluation")
*   **Prerequisite Requirements (numbered list):**

    1.  "Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible"
    2.  "Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license"
    3.  "Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile"
    4.  "Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE\_NAME" (example command)
    5.  "Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository"
*   **Warning:** "If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated."
*   **Evaluation Title:** "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:"
*   **Prerequisite Evaluation Results (statements and results):**

    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS"
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS"
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"
*   **Final Score:**

    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL"
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0"

**Formatting and Style:**

*   The text is relatively simple and straightforward.
*   Key phrases or keywords in the evaluation results ("PASS", "FAIL", "Dockerfile") are potentially in bold.

**Interpretation and Key Takeaways:**

The image indicates that a learner has submitted a project ("Project 1"). A system has automatically checked certain prerequisites related to GitHub, Docker, and licensing. While the Docker image and GitHub repository were present and correctly configured, and the Dockerfile was present, the MIT license was missing from the root of the GitHub repository. As a result, the overall prerequisite check has failed, and the learner's project has a score of 0.

I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as `Licenese.md` but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**General Overview:**
The image is a screenshot of a web page from GitHub Docs. The page guides users on how to add a license to a repository. It presents a step-by-step process with numbered instructions and visual aids showing the interface.

**Key Elements and Text:**

*   **Header:** The GitHub Docs logo and the text "Version: Free, Pro, & Team" are visible.
*   **URL:** The URL of the page is displayed in the address bar: "https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a..."
*   **Navigation Path:** The page's location within the documentation is shown: "Building communities / Healthy contributions / Add a license to a repo"
*   **GitHub Repository Interface:** A partial view of a GitHub repository interface is visible. It shows the "main" branch selector, a file search bar, and a list of files and folders (e.g., ".devcontainer," ".github").
*   **Instructional Steps (numbered):**
    *   **3:** "In the file name field, type `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` (with all caps)."
    *   **4:** "Under the file name, click `Choose a license template`." An image of the file creation screen, and a "Choose a license template" button is highlighted in orange.
    *   **5:** "On the left side of the page, under 'Add a license to your project,' review the available licenses, then select a license from the list."
    *   **6:** "Click Review and submit."
*   **File Name Field:** The image shows a highlighted input field where the user is instructed to type "LICENSE" (shown with the placeholder text "octo-repo / LICENSE in main"
*   **"Choose a license template" Button:** Highlighted in orange is the button labeled "Choose a license template."
*   **"In this article" Section:** On the right side, there's a section titled "In this article" with links to "Including an open source" and "Further reading".

**Overall Content:**

The image provides instructions for adding a license file to a GitHub repository. It outlines the key steps, focusing on the file-naming convention, and using the "Choose a license template" option to simplify the process. The document aims to guide users in a clear, visual manner.

So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

I submitted the project **within the deadline**, and I ensured that **all requirements were fulfilled**, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.

However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.

Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1

I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.

Thank you for your understanding.
