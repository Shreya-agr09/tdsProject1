Hello Sir,

I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.

Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time…

It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.

ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.

Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.  
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.  
*The problem is the lack of time.*

So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.

Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.

Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.

The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.  
But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.

Kind regards

You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.  
I will also add the same in the student seek portal.  
Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!  
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.

Kind regards

Yes our live sessions will be recorded.
That's a stylized image of Monkey D. Luffy, the main protagonist from the anime and manga series *One Piece*. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Luffy's Depiction:** The image shows Luffy from the shoulders up. He's wearing his signature straw hat, which is a bright yellowish-orange. His hair is partially visible beneath the hat.  His expression seems to be one of slight distress or worry, perhaps tinged with determination. He's raising one hand, almost like a small wave or a gesture of greeting.

* **Art Style:** The art style is cute and simplified, not a photorealistic rendering.  The lines are soft and the colors are pastel. It resembles fan art or a character illustration from a less formal setting than official promotional material.


* **Background:** The background is a solid, pale orange-peach color, which keeps the focus firmly on Luffy.

* **Absence of Text:** There is no text visible in the image.


In short, the image is a charming, simplified portrayal of Luffy in a somewhat emotional pose.  The style and character strongly indicate it's *One Piece*-related fan art.
 That's a digital drawing or rendering of what appears to be a stylized version of Monkey D. Luffy, the main protagonist from the popular anime and manga series, One Piece. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Luffy-like Character:** The image depicts a character with features strongly reminiscent of Luffy: short, brown hair peeking out from under a yellow straw hat, a slightly mischievous or playful expression, and a raised arm in a gesture that could be interpreted as a wave or a celebratory fist pump. The style is more cartoony and less detailed than the typical anime depiction of Luffy.

* **Color Palette:** The background is a solid, light orange-peach color.  The character's hat and skin tones are in varying shades of yellow and light brown, creating a warm overall feel.

* **Style:** The art style is simplified, lacking the intricate details and shading often seen in anime. It's more akin to a cute, chibi-style illustration.

* **Lack of Background Details:** There is no discernible background beyond the solid color, keeping the focus entirely on the character.

* **No Text:** There's no text present in the image.

In short, the image is a simple, stylized depiction of a character strongly resembling Luffy from One Piece, presented in a cute, chibi-like manner against a plain background.
 That's a close-up image of stylized artwork featuring a character that strongly resembles Monkey D. Luffy from the anime and manga series *One Piece*. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Character:** The character is depicted from the chest up. They have short, brown hair peeking out from under a yellow, floppy hat. Their eyes are partially closed, possibly indicating a joyful or slightly mischievous expression. One arm is raised in a wave or celebratory gesture. The style is anime-esque, with simplified features and exaggerated expressions.

* **Color Palette:** The background is a pale, peachy orange. This contrasts nicely with the character’s darker hair and yellow hat, making them stand out prominently.

* **Style:** The art style is cute and slightly chibi-like (a style of character design with exaggeratedly large heads and simplified features). The lines are soft, and the overall feel is gentle and playful.

* **No Text:** There is no visible text in the image.


In summary, the image is a fan art depiction of Luffy, likely created for online use or personal enjoyment, given its aesthetic and close-up nature.

Hi @carlton , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.

yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks,  
also when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta
That's a close-up headshot of a man. 


Here's a description:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian descent, with dark hair, brown eyes, and a light complexion. He's wearing rectangular, dark-framed glasses. His expression is pleasant and neutral, almost suggesting a slight smile. He has short, neatly combed hair. His attire consists of a purple collared shirt.

* **The Background:** The background is a solid, pale yellow or beige color, which is fairly uniform and unblemished. It's a simple, uncluttered backdrop that keeps the focus on the man.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low resolution; it's not extremely sharp, and there's a slight blurring, particularly noticeable around the edges.  The compression may also be causing some artifacts.


There is no text visible in the image.  The focus is entirely on the individual's portrait.

That's a close-up image of stylized artwork featuring a character that strongly resembles Monkey D. Luffy from the anime and manga series *One Piece*. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Character:** The illustration depicts Luffy's head and shoulders. He's wearing his signature straw hat. His expression appears to be one of happiness or greeting, as one arm is raised in a wave or celebratory gesture. His eyes are slightly squinted, a common feature in Luffy's depictions. The style is cute and slightly chibi-like, meaning the proportions are exaggerated to appear more cartoonish and adorable.

* **The Style:** The art style is soft and slightly painterly, not sharp and defined lines. The colors are warm and muted, with a pale orange or peach background that complements Luffy's yellow hat and brown hair. 

* **Lack of Background:** The background is a simple, solid, light orange color, drawing all attention to the character. There are no other discernible details or objects in the background.

* **No Text:** There's no text present in the image.


In short, the image is a charming, stylized portrait of Luffy from *One Piece*, designed for aesthetic appeal rather than narrative detail.
 That's a digital drawing or rendering of a character that strongly resembles Monkey D. Luffy from the anime and manga series *One Piece*. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Character:** The image shows Luffy's head and shoulders. He's wearing his signature straw hat and has his characteristic wide-eyed, slightly mischievous expression. His arm is raised in a wave or a celebratory gesture.  His hair is visible beneath the hat.

* **Style:** The art style is fairly soft and rounded, not highly detailed. It appears to be a fan-made illustration rather than official artwork from the *One Piece* series. The coloring is simple, using mostly shades of orange and yellow, with a pale orange background.


* **Background:** The background is a solid, light orange color, providing a simple backdrop that focuses attention on the character.


There is no text in the image.  The only notable features are the stylized depiction of Luffy and the color scheme.
 That's a stylized image of Monkey D. Luffy, the main protagonist of the popular anime and manga series *One Piece*.

The image shows Luffy from the shoulders up. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Luffy's Appearance:** He's depicted in his characteristic straw hat, which is a bright, yellowish-gold color. His hair is visible underneath the hat, brown and somewhat messy.  His face is partially visible; he appears to be smiling or grinning with his eyes slightly squinted. He's raising his right fist in a celebratory gesture.  The art style is cute and chibi-like (exaggeratedly large head and small body), making him appear younger and more endearing than his usual depiction.

* **Background and Setting:** The background is a simple, solid, light orange-peach color, which is quite plain and draws attention to Luffy himself. There's no discernible setting or environment.

* **Overall Style:** The art style is likely fan art due to its informal nature and simplified features. The lines are soft and less detailed than the official *One Piece* art. The color palette is limited but pleasant, sticking to warm tones.

There is no text present in the image.

Here's a description:

* **The Person:** The image shows a man with tan skin, dark hair styled neatly, and wearing rectangular, dark-framed glasses. He has a slight smile and appears to be in his twenties or thirties. He's wearing a dark purple collared shirt.

* **The Background:** The background is a plain, light yellowish-beige color, providing a neutral backdrop that focuses attention on the individual.

* **Image Quality:** The image is somewhat low resolution; the details are slightly soft, and there's a lack of sharp focus. This suggests it might be a photograph taken with a phone camera or a lower-quality digital camera.

There is no text present in the image.  The focus is entirely on the person's portrait.
