Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Subject:** The image features a portion of an anime character.

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Character Fragment:** The visible part of the character includes the top of their head, face, and one arm raised.
*   **Hat:** The character is wearing a distinctive straw hat with a red band around it.
*   **Facial Features:** The visible eye appears to be large and expressive, typical of anime style.
*   **Raised Arm:** The arm is raised in what might be a greeting or a gesture of enthusiasm.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid, uniform color, possibly light orange or yellow.

**Possible Interpretations:**

*   **Style:** The artwork is consistent with the style of many anime series.

If you have specific questions about the image, feel free to ask!
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:** The image features a large, bright red interrobang symbol.

**Breakdown:**

*   **Symbol:** An interrobang is a punctuation mark combining the function of a question mark and an exclamation point in one glyph (glyph: visual representation of a character or symbol). It expresses a question in an excited manner.

*   **Color:** The symbol is a vivid red color.

*   **Background:** The background is black, which creates a strong contrast, making the interrobang stand out prominently.

*   **Style:** The image has a pixelated style, which is indicative of it being potentially a low-resolution image or an intentional design choice to create a retro or digital aesthetic.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image depicts a yellow emoji-style face expressing contemplation or thoughtfulness.

**Key Features:**

*   **Facial Expression:** The emoji has a furrowed brow (raised left eyebrow), a slightly downturned mouth, and its eyes are looking forward. Its hand is positioned under its chin in a typical "thinking" pose.
*   **Color:** The emoji is a bright yellow color.
*   **Shape:** The emoji is a smooth, round circle.

Based on these features, this image clearly represents the "thinking face" emoji, commonly used to indicate someone is pondering a question or concept.
 Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Content:**

The image shows a yellow smiley face emoji wearing glasses. The emoji has the following features:

*   **Color:** The base color of the face is a bright yellow.
*   **Facial expression:** The emoji has a wide, open mouth with visible white teeth and a pink tongue, indicating a cheerful or happy expression.
*   **Eyes:** The emoji is wearing glasses with a thick square yellow frame.
*   **Overall impression:** The emoji projects a "nerdy" or "intellectual" vibe due to the glasses. It suggests intelligence, cleverness, or perhaps someone who enjoys learning or studying.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image features an emoji. It's a bright yellow circular face with the following characteristics:

*   **Facial Expression:** The face is smiling broadly with an open mouth. You can see the teeth (white) and the tongue (pink/red). The expression overall is cheerful and excited.
*   **Eyeglasses:** The emoji is wearing large, square-rimmed eyeglasses. The rims of the glasses appear to be gold or yellow in color.
*   **Background:** The background is black, making the yellow face and glasses stand out prominently.

**Overall Impression:**

The emoji is a classic representation of a "nerd," "geek," or "intelligent person," often associated with being excited or enthusiastic about something. The glasses are a key visual cue that contributes to this perception.
 Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the image content:

Hello Sir,

I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image features text against a dark gray background. 

At the top, in a large, clean font, it reads "Deploy your application".

Below this title, there is a thin, horizontal line that acts as a separator.

Beneath the line, a longer paragraph of text states: "Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel." This text is in a smaller font size than the title and provides more context to the heading. The text is a light gray color.

If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results

Any question from first 5 Ga’s can be there and you would need to analyze which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well. Function calling is better approach here.

Hi @24f2006531

You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)

Kind regards

Here's a detailed description of the image:

*   **Character:** The image shows the top half of a character's face. The character has short, dark hair.

*   **Clothing/Hat:** The character is wearing a distinctive yellow straw hat with a red band around the crown. This hat is a very recognizable feature.

*   **Background:** The background is a plain, solid light-orange color.

*   **Overall Impression:** The style of the character appears to be anime-inspired. The overall simplicity of the image suggests it could be a profile picture or icon.

Without further information, it's difficult to definitively determine who the character is. However, based on the distinctive hat, the character is likely Monkey D. Luffy from the anime and manga series "One Piece".
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

*   **Content:** The image displays a red interrobang symbol.
*   **Interrobang:** An interrobang is a nonstandard punctuation mark used in various written languages. It combines the functions of the question mark and the exclamation point, ending a sentence in a blend of query and interjection.
*   **Color:** The interrobang is colored red.
*   **Background:** The background is solid black.
*   **Style:** The symbol has a pixelated appearance, suggesting it might be from a low-resolution image or created with a retro, pixel-art style.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image is a digital depiction of an emoji. The emoji features a yellow face with a thoughtful or questioning expression.

**Key Features:**

*   **Facial Expression:** The emoji's expression is characterized by:
    *   A furrowed brow, with the left eyebrow slightly raised.
    *   A slightly frowning mouth.
    *   Large, round eyes that seem to be looking upward or into the distance.
*   **Hand Gesture:** The emoji's hand is raised to its chin in a thinking pose. The index finger is touching the chin, indicating contemplation.
*   **Color:** The emoji's face and hand are a bright yellow color.
*   **Style:** The emoji has a clean, simple design with smooth lines and shading to give it a 3D effect.

Overall, the image portrays a "thinking face" emoji, commonly used to represent thoughtfulness, questioning, pondering, or skepticism.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:** The image shows a single emoji. 

**Details:**

*   **Subject:** The emoji is a yellow smiling face.
*   **Facial Features:** It has a wide, open mouth with visible teeth and tongue.
*   **Accessories:** The most notable feature is a pair of large, black-rimmed glasses. These glasses contribute to the "nerd" or "geek" association of the emoji.
*   **Overall Impression:** The emoji has a cheerful and slightly enthusiastic expression, enhanced by the glasses which gives the impression of intelligence or studiousness. It represents someone who is excited, perhaps about a topic or subject they find interesting.
 Certainly! Let's analyze the image.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of text or a segment from a webpage, likely related to application deployment. It has a clean, minimalist design with a dark background.

**Text Content:**

*   **Title:** "Deploy your application" (Appears in a larger, bolder font than the rest of the text, making it the heading.)
*   **Sub-text:** "Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel." (This text provides more details and instructions.)

**Visual Features:**

*   **Background:** A dark color background, likely a shade of gray or blue-gray.
*   **Text Color:** The text is in a light color, likely white or a light shade of gray/blue, which contrasts well with the background for readability.
*   **Underline:** There is a horizontal line separating the title from the sub-text. It's visually subtle and probably the same color as the sub-text.

**Interpretation:**

The content of the image is an invitation to deploy an application. The text explains that deploying the application makes it accessible to anyone via a public URL and suggests that a wide variety of platforms are suitable for deployment, with "Vercel" being mentioned as an example. This implies that the text may come from a tutorial, guide, or documentation related to software deployment.

@Jivraj  
Could we have a tutorial-type session, similar to the one provided for Project 1, just before the deadline?

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/22](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/22)

There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).  
Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:  
Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?

Some other doubts are

1. Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)
2. Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)
3. Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)
4. Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)

How do we account for this? @Jivraj @s.anand @carlton

I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.

1. Are we supposed to use OpenAI api’s or locally/private hosted one?
2. Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?
3. Can we work in a team and submit the project together?
4. If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally
5. Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?

@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
Dear Sir,  
I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.

1. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI `gh` which we have to install in the vercel instance using `apt` package manager.  
   But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.
2. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?  
   Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install `ngrok` package.
3. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires `docker` package installed.
4. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?
5. Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?
6. And many more

Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.  
Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.

Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24\*7 during evaluation.

I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.

Also, some ques requires external toolings like

1. In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.
2. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?
3. GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally.

How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.

Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like

1. In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI.
2. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?

Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API\_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.

Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.

If you are talking about the parameters of those questions, then it would be better if you make your API capable of working with different parameters.

Well if your API is capable of solving those questions in your GAs with the expected answer, then that’s sufficient validation.

If you are indicating towards working collaboratively then,  
Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks. Which is why it is sensible to work collectively.

Hello Sir,

I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.

1. Currently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes.
2. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.
3. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence\_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?
4. How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

What does it mean to solve the question?  
Everyone is asking that?  
Do you yourself know what to do and to go about it?  
Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment?

“and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.”  
From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered… For example it states in the project that   
" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:"  
If you all still have not responded, then I’m honestly not sure if this is what y’all meant.  
Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.

I understand that y’all want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don’t what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   **Main Subject:** The image features a single hand emoji.
*   **Orientation:** The hand is oriented with the fingers pointing downwards.
*   **Skin Tone:** The hand appears to have a light skin tone.
*   **Artistic Style:** The image is rendered in a cartoonish, emoji style.

I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.

Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference.

Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.

Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it.

Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.

To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:

* Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)
* Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)
* Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)
* Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)
* Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)
* Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)
* Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)
* Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)

AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor
---------------------------

Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.

To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type `code -s`, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.

What is the output of `code -s`? The output of `code -s` cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.

As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.

Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web application designed as an assignment helper, specifically for IIT Madras Data Science graded assignments. The layout is clean and simple with a white background. The main components are:

1.  **Header:** This section contains the title "IIT Madras Assignment Helper" and a brief welcome message explaining the tool's purpose.

2.  **Question Input Area:** This area is labelled "Ask a Question" and allows the user to enter a text-based question. It contains a scrollable text box where the question is inputted.

3.  **File Upload (Optional):** This section provides the option to upload an assignment file using a "Choose File" button. A "No file chosen" indicator is displayed next to the button when no file has been selected.

4.  **"Get Answer" Button:** A green button labeled "Get Answer" is present, likely triggering the application to process the question and provide an answer.

5.  **Answer Display Area:** This section labeled "Answer:" displays the answer generated by the application in text format.

**Content Details:**

*   **Question Text:** The text within the question input box contains the following:
    *   The text "aperturmatig puss" followed by the actual question.
    *   "Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-16T06:36:30.3672 with at least 1 comment with 5 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post\_id, and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.
        Check the console for the result of your query."

*   **Answer Text:** The displayed answer is a SQL query:
    *   "sql SELECT post\_id FROM social\_media WHERE timestamp >= 2025-01-16T06:36:30.367Z AND EXISTS(
        SELECT 1 FROM json\_each(comments) WHERE json\_extract(value, $.stars.useful)::INT > 5 ) ORDER BY post\_id;"

**Key elements:**

*   The image displays a query designed to retrieve `post_id` from a `social_media` table.
*   The query filters the posts based on a timestamp and ensures that the associated comments have at least 5 useful stars.
*   The output is ordered by `post_id`.

In summary, the image shows an assignment helper application used for data science tasks, specifically demonstrating how to input a DuckDB SQL query-related question and retrieve the corresponding SQL-based solution.

and this is also working with simple question
Here's a detailed description of the content of the image:

**Overall Image:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a command-line interface (CLI), specifically a Windows command prompt. It shows the execution of a `curl` command and its output.

**Textual Content:**

1.  **Prompt:**
    *   `D:\Yantravid>`: This indicates the current directory in the command prompt. It suggests the user is working within a directory named "Yantravid" on the D drive.

2.  **`curl` Command:**
    *   `curl -X POST "https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/" -F "question=What is 2+2?"`: This is the core command being executed. Let's break it down:
        *   `curl`:  This is the command-line tool used to make HTTP requests.
        *   `-X POST`:  Specifies that a POST request is being sent to the specified URL.
        *   `"https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/"`:  This is the URL the POST request is being sent to. It appears to be an endpoint on a Vercel-hosted application.
        *   `-F "question=What is 2+2?"`:  This option sends the data "question=What is 2+2?" as a form field in the POST request. It looks like the command is sending a question to the API.

3.  **`curl` Output:**
    *   `{"answer":"4"}`:  This is the response received from the API endpoint after the `curl` command was executed. It's in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, indicating the API returned an answer to the question. The API provided the answer "4".

4.  **New Prompt:**
    *   `D:\Yantravid>`: This is the command prompt reappearing after the command has finished execution. It indicates that the user can now enter a new command.

**Interpretation:**

The user is sending a question to an API using the `curl` command. The API takes the question "What is 2+2?" and returns the answer "4" in a JSON format.

In essence, this shows a simple interaction with a web API, where a question is sent as a POST request and the API returns a corresponding answer in JSON format.

image1260×149 8.95 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

The image is a screenshot of a command-line interface, likely a terminal or console window.  The prompt is "D:\Yantravid\yantravid>".

The main content shows a `curl` command being executed, split across multiple lines using the caret symbol `^` to indicate continuation.  The command makes a POST request to the URL "https://yantravid-git-main-vicky-kumars-projects-5400c012.vercel.app/api/". The request includes two form fields ("-F" options).

The first form field, named "question", contains instructions for the server, which includes:
1.  Downloading and extracting a ZIP file named "qmove.zip".
2.  Moving all files under folders into an empty folder.
3.  Renaming files: Each digit in a filename is replaced with the next digit (1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0).  An example is provided: "a1b9c.txt" becomes "a2b0c.txt".
4.  Executing `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash on the relevant folder and showing the output.

The second form field is named "file" and its value is the content of the file located at "D:\Yantravid\yantravid\test_data\qmove.zip". The "@" symbol indicates that this is a file upload.

Finally, the output of the `curl` command shows a JSON response. The JSON object has a single key "answer" which contains value: "text\ne086115d65479e8562262a61e17e4568880561732b2d6e81117e041681883191".

Sir, for GA-5 question number 3 the file is too large to send via request to vercel  
possible solution is uploading on google drive or smth like that but how will u guys send such long files plus the project only mention sending files not url …Kindly clarify regarding this.

Here, the questions entered after the endpoint will be exactly same as the GAs or be similar as the GAs ??
Here is a detailed description of the image's content:

The image presents two lines of text describing an API endpoint for an application. Both lines are written against a dark gray background.

**First Line:**

*   The line starts with "Your application exposes an API endpoint. Let's assume that it is at".
*   It then provides a placeholder URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. This URL is highlighted or displayed differently, likely in a distinct font or color, to emphasize that it's an example or should be replaced with the actual application's URL.
*   The line ends with a period ".".

**Second Line:**

*   The line begins with "The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g.".
*   It provides an example of a POST request: `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. The "POST" is likely to indicate the HTTP method being used. The URL is the same as in the first line.
*   The text specifies that the request should include "with the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data.". This indicates that the API endpoint expects data to be sent as part of the request, possibly including a text question and/or files using the `multipart/form-data` encoding, which is commonly used for file uploads.

In essence, the image describes an API endpoint, its URL structure, the required HTTP method (POST), and the expected format of the request data. It specifies that the endpoint should handle both text questions and optional file attachments.

My Approach , is to

1. scrape and parse all the current question
2. create embeddings , of the questions.
3. create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions
4. segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1
5. Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers. need to see if an MCP server can come in handy  
   to deploy a server and return an url

Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally, to check for the accuracy of solving the question.

1. I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.
2. Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)  
   Thanks!

Does anyone willing to work with me..?

Should we answer the questions and return the response to enter in the answer box(as stated in the question) or should we just provide instructions on how to go about solving the question? Some of the questions include pictures and we cannot use LLM for pictures.

They(instructors) only don’t what to do it looks like, Anand Sir will tell them and they will tell you (with 25-50 percent lossy communication), just wait and keeping tagging Anand Sir. He will explain clearly, Ask everyone to push for a live session with Anand Sir , that 40 mins he explains will be worth its weight in gold, Hope he does that. Flattery gets me everywhere (not really, I really think Anand Sir is OP. Check out his YT )! @s.anand

should we make the functions on the basis of the GAs or should we make it general so it will be able to perform the task but the data provided will be different.

The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks.

So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents.

1. Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request)
2. Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer.
3. Give the answer back as specified.

Kind regards

carlton:

> You do not need to do the task as the GA required.

Does this mean this type of question won’t be paramaterized?

Like instead of `code -s` there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all?

The same confusion is for these type of questions as well:

A bit more clarity would be helpful. Thanks in advance.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a man, likely in his late 20s or early 30s, posing for what appears to be a headshot or portrait.

**Person:**

*   **Gender:** Male
*   **Ethnicity:** Appears to be of South Asian descent (based on facial features and complexion)
*   **Facial Features:**
    *   Dark hair, neatly styled
    *   Brown eyes
    *   Smiling slightly
    *   Wearing rectangular-framed glasses.
*   **Attire:** Wearing a purple button-down shirt with the top button open.

**Background:**

*   The background is a solid, pale yellow or off-white color, suggesting it might be a wall or a plain backdrop. It's featureless, without any discernible patterns or objects.

**Lighting and Composition:**

*   The lighting is soft and even, casting minimal shadows on the face.
*   The composition is straightforward, with the focus directly on the man's face. The shot is from the chest up, which is a standard format for headshots.

**Key Features:**

*   **Glasses:** The style of glasses is noteworthy.
*   **Expression:** The slight smile conveys a sense of approachability and friendliness.

**Overall Impression:** The image suggests a professional or semi-professional context, possibly used for a LinkedIn profile, website, or other promotional material.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Text:**

*   "Install and run Visual Studio Code. In your Terminal (or Command Prompt), type code -s and press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below."
*   "What is the output of code -s?"

**Context and Analysis:**

*   The image provides instructions to run the command "code -s" in a terminal or command prompt.  "code" likely refers to the Visual Studio Code executable.
*   The "-s" is a command line flag or option passed to the "code" command. Its specific function would depend on how Visual Studio Code is designed to interpret it.
*   The overall goal is to capture the output of that command and provide it as input.

In summary, the image is a prompt asking the user to execute a specific command related to Visual Studio Code in their terminal and then report the resulting output.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**General Layout:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot from an online assessment or learning platform.
*   It presents two questions related to writing formulas in spreadsheet software (Google Sheets and Excel).
*   Each question consists of instructions, a formula, a space to enter the result, and a "Check" button.

**Question 1 (Google Sheets):**

*   **Instructions:**  "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel)"
*   **Formula:** `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6), 1, 10))`
    *   This formula uses several Google Sheets functions:
        *   `SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 6)`: Creates a sequence of numbers starting at 100, incrementing by 15, and creates 6 columns with 100 row by 100 values.
        *   `ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(..., 1, 10)`: Constrains the array created by the `SEQUENCE` function. The array is constrained to the first row (1) and the first ten columns (10).
        *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of the constrained array.
*   **Prompt:**  "What is the result?"
*   **Elements:** A fill-in text box for the student's answer and a "Check" button.

**Question 2 (Excel):**

*   **Mark:** The text (0.25 marks) indicates that it is a test or a graded material.
*   **Instructions:** "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Excel. Type this formula into Excel."
*   **Note:**  "This will ONLY work in Office 365."
*   **Formula:** `=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY((3,14,6,10,3,12,9,6,3,12,15,4,11,11,4,14), (10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12)), 1, 9))`
    *   This formula uses functions exclusive to newer versions of Excel (Office 365):
        *   `SORTBY(array, by_array)`: Sorts an array based on the values in another array.
        *   `TAKE(array, rows, [columns])`: Returns a specified number of rows or columns from the beginning or end of an array.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of the extracted values.
*   **Prompt:** "What is the result?"
*   **Note:** "Note: If you get #NAME? you have the wrong version of Excel. Find a friend for whom this works." (This is a helpful hint to the student.)
*   **Elements:** A fill-in text box for the student's answer and a "Check" button.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The image presents two distinct spreadsheet formula questions.
*   One is targeted toward Google Sheets users, while the other is for Excel (specifically Office 365) users.
*   The formulas are designed to test the student's understanding of array manipulation, sequencing, sorting, and conditional calculations within the respective spreadsheet environments.
*   The notes provide helpful context and troubleshooting guidance to the student.

> Like instead of `code -s` there won’t be any other command, otherwise it would require installation of VS Code inside a container to find the answer or this type of questions won’t be part of evaluation at all?

there will not be any other command. This question can be solved with a hardcoded answer

Excel and Google sheet questions can be solved by just using python . No excel or google sheets required.

The question WILL be parameterised however. So the numbers might be different. You should just understand what the question is asking and solve it programatically to get the answer.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a man's head and shoulders in a dimly lit environment. The lighting is predominantly green, giving the scene a somewhat mysterious or dramatic feel.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Subject:** The central focus is a man with short, dark hair and a beard. His head is turned slightly to the side, suggesting he is either looking at something or in the middle of a conversation.
*   **Expression:** He has a neutral to slightly intense expression, perhaps mid-sentence. This contributes to the feeling of dynamism in the image.
*   **Lighting:** The green light casts shadows and highlights, shaping the contours of his face. It's a key element of the image's mood. The lighting also suggests an artificial or staged environment, possibly a nightclub or performance setting.
*   **Clothing:** He appears to be wearing a dark-colored top. The details of the clothing are difficult to make out due to the lighting conditions.
*   **Background:** The background is dark and out of focus. There's not much to discern beyond the general darkness, which keeps the focus primarily on the man.
*   **Features:** His eyebrows are dark and well-defined, and he has what appear to be glasses.

I am not sure how you came to that conclusion!

For example vercel question still requires a vercel endpoint that will respond.

What I said is some questions might not need you to use those specific tools. Your answers should still be legitimate answers that one can paste into the text box of a GA and still get it correct.

The only question that will not be asked is the LLM say yes question.

A github account would still need you to commit a file to it and provide the url that is reachable.

etc.

Hi TAs,

I attended the meet which happened today. But I don’t clearly get one thing.

Most of the questions have a **question text** and a **file: csv,zip,json,etc**

My doubt is, will the request to the end point be :

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting"

```

> my doubt :  
> Is this the only format or can there be other too ?

Hi @23f2000573

Yes this is correct format for the question, It will have 2 fields question and file.

You can send a file from local machine like this `-F "file=@abcd.zip"` so here `abcd.zip` must be in current working directory.

Kind regards

Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn’t need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.

FILES
-----

The data file sent to the api will always be in the **requester’s** local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?

Or

Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png

This link was take from GA2 Question 2

HTML AND TABLE
--------------

Some questions have `html` and `tables`. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.

Example for string. Consider the table

| Col 1 | Col 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2 Col 2 |

Will this be something like this

```
"|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|"

```

or something like

```
"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Col 1</th>\n<th>Col 2</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>
"

```

HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS
---------------------------------

In one question, there were two tasks.

* Find the answer to the question
* Enable the `disabled` text block

In this question, what will the answer type be?

Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block

MORE THAN ONE FILE
------------------

Some questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp and a table.

In this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question text" \
  -F "file= Image file" \
  -F "file= table file/ string" 

```

CORS HEADERS
------------

Will the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/68](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/68)

Hi,  
In GA 2, q5, this is the code i got in the question.

```
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

# There is a mistake in the line below. Fix it
image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys)[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.554)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.554: {light_pixels}')

```

Is this the code for others as well?  
Thanks

So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:

→ the set of question-answers pairs at first  
→ All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions  
→ Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.

Till now I have created the following:

→ Identification of the question, using embeddings  
→ extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question  
→ Implementation of 3 questions using this approach

If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.

\*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM. I might not respond immediately as I might not be online all the time
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a single emoji. It's a classic smiley face.

**Features:**

*   **Shape:** The emoji is circular.
*   **Color:** The face is a bright yellow.
*   **Eyes:** It has two small, oval eyes, colored brown.
*   **Mouth:** The mouth is a simple, curved line, representing a smile.
*   **Overall Impression:** The emoji conveys happiness, contentment, or a positive sentiment.

There is no text or other objects in the image.

file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

This is correct html table format.

23f2000573:

It will be just answer.

In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

I didn’t get this question, could you point to exact question?

Sir, a few things are not yet clear .

Jivraj:

> file format will be exactly same as corresponding GA.

Some questions have **clickable html buttons**. When we click that, the zipfile or json file, or csv gets downloaded

Some questions have **image attached to the text**. For this, we have to use **right click → download the image**. Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png.

My doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command

Will it be

* “file=binary of zipfile/csv/json” for the first type and
* “file=https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png” for the second type

Jivraj:

> This is correct html table format.

Will this table be in the “question” attribute of curl or “file” attribute

Jivraj:

> In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.

so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?

@22f3002723
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a Google Meet session, likely taken during a video call or online meeting. The quality is somewhat grainy or low-resolution.

**Main Subject:**

*   **Individual:** The central focus is on an individual (likely named Anand S, as noted at the bottom left). The individual appears to be middle-aged with graying hair and a serious expression. The person is wearing a headset microphone setup.

**Text and Logos:**

*   **"Google Meet" Logo:** In the top right corner, there is a "Google Meet" logo, which confirms the platform used.
*   **"Anand S":** The name "Anand S" is visible in the bottom left corner of the screen, probably the name of the user.

**Background:**

*   **Wall:** The background is a plain white wall.
*   **Electrical Outlet:** On the left side of the wall, an electrical outlet is visible with a wire connected to it.
*   **Circular Shape:** There is a somewhat indistinct circular pattern or shadow on the wall behind the person, possibly from a light fixture or decoration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The lighting is uneven, creating some shadows on the individual's face.
*   The person appears to be looking directly at the camera.

Hi @23f2000573

23f2000573:

> Will it be

Files will be exactly same as GA assignment, if there is url then it will be a url and if it get’s downloaded by clicking then it will come from requester’s machine.

23f2000573:

> so, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the “question” attribute and the image in the “file” attribute?

For questions that have table they will either come as html code or as markdown. Keep a if else condition for identifying which case it is, if it’s a html then beautiful soup should be able to find table tag, if it’s markdown table then it can be identified with `|` characters.

Kind regards
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a single capital letter "G" in white against a solid purple background. The "G" appears to be in a sans-serif font and has a slightly blurred or out-of-focus appearance, giving it a soft or glowing effect.
 Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a white letter "G" displayed against a solid purple background. The letter is slightly blurred, suggesting it might be a zoomed-in or low-resolution version.

**Key Features:**

*   **Letter:** The central element is the white, uppercase letter "G".
*   **Background:** The background is a flat, uniform shade of purple.
*   **Blur:** The entire image appears slightly blurred, possibly due to resizing or image quality.

Let me know if you have any other questions!

For GA 1, question 2  

Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 4.17.09 PM960×336 28.9 KB

  
The portal accept answers in strict json with double quotes. Now in the project we need to return the answer in string value which again has double quotes, so the best answer I could get is using `\"` inside the answer like this.

But still the GA portal marks it as invalid json. What to do in this case?  
@carlton @Jivraj
Here's a detailed breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a question or challenge related to HTTP requests and Python programming.  It presents instructions, a task, and a space for an answer.

**Textual Content:**

1.  **Instructions:**
    *   "Running uv run --with httpie https [URL] installs the Python package httpie and sends a HTTPS request to the URL." -  This provides context about using the `httpie` package within a `uv run` environment to make HTTPS requests.
    *   "Send a HTTPS request to https://httpbin.org/get with the URL encoded parameter email set to 21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" -  This is the core task. It asks the user to make a request to the specified URL, including an `email` parameter in the URL's query string.
    *   "What is the JSON output of the command? (Paste only the JSON body, not the headers)" -  This specifies what the user needs to provide as an answer: the JSON response body (excluding the headers) resulting from the HTTP request.

2.  **Answer Field:**
    *   There is a text field containing the following JSON:
        ```json
        { "args": { "email": "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" }, "headers": { "Accept": "*/*", "Accept-Encodir
        ```
        It looks like the beginning of a JSON response. It contains two keys: "args" and "headers". The "args" section contains the "email" value specified in the question, while the "headers" section contains the "Accept" value.

3.  **Button:**
    *   A "Check" button likely used to submit the answer.

**Interpretation:**

The task is to use `httpie` (or a similar tool) to send an HTTP GET request to `https://httpbin.org/get` with a URL-encoded parameter `email` set to `21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`. The `httpbin.org` service will echo back the details of the request, including the URL parameters and request headers. The question requires the user to extract the JSON body from the response (excluding the headers) and submit it as the answer.

**In Summary:** The image describes a programming task involving sending an HTTP request with a specific URL parameter and then extracting the relevant part of the JSON response as the answer.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on the text and relevant features:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image displays a snippet of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. JSON is a standard text-based format for representing structured data.
*   The text is displayed in a dark-themed coding environment (e.g., a code editor or terminal).

**Key JSON Elements:**

*   **"answer":** This is the top-level key, indicating that the subsequent data represents an answer or response.
*   **"args":** This key contains arguments, including an "email" value.
    *   **"email": "21f2000709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"**: This represents an email address, which likely belongs to a student (ds.study domain).
*   **"headers":** This key contains HTTP headers.
    *   **"Accept": "\*/\*"**: The "Accept" header indicates the media types the client is willing to accept. "\*/\*" means it accepts any media type.
    *   **"Accept-Encoding":**: Indicates the encoding the client can handle. It seems there are encodings like "deflate".
*   Other keys like "Host" and "HTTPin" are present but incomplete.

**In Summary:**

The JSON data represents a response that includes arguments passed to a request. One argument is the student's email address (from IITM).
The HTTP headers further specify how a client is set up to accept data.

Hi @21f2000709

image654×681 13.1 KB

This works, just send a string which can be loaded as json object.
Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Context:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an interactive coding environment, most likely a Python Jupyter Notebook or similar interface. It shows a series of code inputs and their corresponding outputs.

**Code Snippets:**

*   **In \[28]: jobj**

    *   This line simply displays the current value of a variable named `jobj`.
    *   **Out\[28]: "{'name':'jivraj'}"**
    *   The output shows that `jobj` currently holds a string representation of a dictionary. Notice that the keys and values are enclosed in single quotes within the double quotes, which is not the correct JSON format.

*   **In \[29]: jobj = '{"name":"jivraj"}'**

    *   This line assigns a new string value to `jobj`. The string represents a JSON object with a key "name" and a value "jivraj".

*   **In \[30]: jobj**

    *   Displays the current value of the variable `jobj` again.
    *   **Out\[30]: '{"name":"jivraj"}'**
    *   The output confirms that `jobj` now holds the JSON string we just assigned to it.

*   **In \[31]: json.loads(jobj)**

    *   This line attempts to use the `json.loads()` function to parse the string stored in `jobj` into a Python dictionary. The `json.loads()` function expects a string in JSON format.
    *   **Out\[31]: {'name': 'jivraj'}**
    *   The output shows that `json.loads()` successfully parsed the JSON string and created a Python dictionary where the key is "name" and the value is 'jivraj'.

*   **In \[32]: json.loads(jobj)\['name']**

    *   This line first parses the JSON string in `jobj` into a dictionary (just like the previous line) and then attempts to access the value associated with the key 'name'.
    *   **Out\[32]: 'jivraj'**
    *   The output is 'jivraj', which is the value associated with the 'name' key in the parsed dictionary.

*   **In \[33]: type(jobj)**

    *   This line checks the data type of the variable `jobj`.
    *   **Out\[33]: str**
    *   The output confirms that `jobj` is a string (str). This is important because even though it *represents* JSON data, it is still just a string.

*   **In \[34]:**

    *   This line shows the prompt for the next input. It's empty, indicating that no code has been entered yet.

**Key Observations and Potential Issues:**

*   The variable `jobj` contains a string representing a JSON object.
*   The `json.loads()` function is used to convert this string into a Python dictionary, which is a more usable format for working with the data.
*   The `type(jobj)` output confirms that `jobj` itself is a string, not a dictionary, even after the JSON data is loaded.

The correct answer has to be with the escape sequence otherwise you cannot send a valid response back.  
We never feed your response to the GA by copy pasting.

Screenshot 2025-03-21 at 5.28.12 pm.png1744×1084 147 KB
The image shows a Python code snippet and its corresponding output.

First, a dictionary named `response` is initialized. It has one key-value pair where the key is "answer" and the value is a string representing a JSON-like structure containing an "args" dictionary and a "challenge" key with the question "How can TDS ever hope to solve this problem?".

Then, the `json` module is imported.

The `json.dumps()` method converts the `response` dictionary into a JSON string, which is then assigned to the `send_response` variable. The `indent=2` argument ensures the JSON string is formatted with an indent of 2 spaces for readability.  The JSON string is printed to the console.

Next, `json.loads()` is used to parse the `send_response` string back into a Python dictionary. The value associated with the "answer" key is extracted from the parsed dictionary and assigned to the `tds_evaluator` variable.  This variable is then printed.

Finally, the string "OH MY GOODNESS! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THIS IS AMAZING!" is printed to the console.

So the questions expecting JSON will be jsonified separately before passing to the evaluator because in the current implementation in the text field idk why it is failing to load the json with `\"` however I could load the exact thing using json.loads in python.

hi @carlton @Jivraj !  
could you please provide us with the correct answers for all the 57 GA questions, so that it would be really helpful for us to cross check if our app is returning the correct answer for each question. please consider sharing the correct answers for all the questions as they are not available in the seek portal as well

Hi @23f2003413

We won’t be sending codes for any of the questions, regarding validation part you can submit answer to portal and if that works.

All first 5 GA’s were conducted on anand sir’s proxy server portal, so just enable check answers button and you can test answers.

For questions like this (there’s a similar one in GA1 too, will the user send the USER and REPO of their GitHub account as parameters too?  
Even if they do, my script may not get necessary authentication to create repo and make commit in their repository. In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?  
If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.  
Can you please at least hint at a solution?

Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)

Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags.
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of a phone screen showing a webpage or app, likely related to a task or assignment. The text on the screen provides instructions on publishing a webpage using GitHub Pages and ensuring a specific email address is included in the HTML, with guidance on how to handle potential email obfuscation.

**Key Text and Instructions:**

*   **Headline:** "TDS 2025 Ja..." (The full name is cropped off. TDS might stand for Term-end submission.)
*   **Domain:** "anand.workers.dev" (This seems to be the URL of the page being viewed.)
*   **Core Instruction:** "Publish a page using GitHub Pages that showcases your work. Ensure that your email address `22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is in the page's HTML." This is the main task to be performed.
*   **CloudFlare and Email Obfuscation:** "GitHub pages are served via CloudFlare which obfuscates emails. So, wrap your email address inside a:" This highlights a potential problem and suggests a solution.
*   **HTML Comment Snippet:** `<!--email_off-->22f3000819@ds.study.i` This provides the specific code snippet for wrapping the email address to prevent obfuscation.
*   **GitHub Pages URL Format:** "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`" This provides a template for constructing the GitHub Pages URL, indicating that the user needs to replace "[USER]" and "[REPO]" with appropriate values.
*   **Cache Busting:** "If a recent change that's not reflected, add? v=1, ?v=2 to the URL to bust the cache." This provides information on how to force the browser to reload the latest version of the page by adding a query parameter to the URL.
*   **Button:** "Check" (This suggests that the page is part of an interactive exercise or assessment where the user can submit their solution for verification.)
*   **Footer:** "Use Google Colab (0.5 marks)"

**Notable Objects:**

*   **Phone UI elements:** The screenshot includes the phone's status bar (battery level, time, network connection) and navigation buttons (home, back).

**Overall Meaning:**

The image is a task or instruction manual for publishing a webpage on GitHub Pages while addressing a specific concern about email address obfuscation caused by CloudFlare. It provides a template for the GitHub Pages URL and instructions on cache-busting if changes are not reflected.

Use the following script to enable answer boxes and check answers buttons:

```
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons  = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

For GA-1 question 10,  
we need to get the hash of the json, from the site JSON Hash,  
I found that underneath it using sha-256 in a function inside the encrypt.js file but still when I implemented the same in python, it is giving a different hash. Can we get the hashing code in python?

@carlton @Jivraj

Update:

* I was successful in getting the hash in js.

You won’t be required to update someone else’s repo.  
Any github name, repo name is fine.  
Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address.

22f3000819:

> Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)

Same for GA2 Quetion7 as well, you github url is required.

22f3000819:

> If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.  
> Can you please at least hint at a solution?

In evaluation we will only send request one worst case twice or thrice if it fails from our end, so no issues with that.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image consists of a single letter "S" centered against a solid blue background.

**Details:**

*   **Letter "S":** The letter "S" is rendered in a white or light gray color, giving it a slightly blurred or soft appearance. It's in a clean, simple font, likely sans-serif, and appears to be a lowercase "s".
*   **Background:** The background is a vibrant, solid blue color. The specific shade of blue is difficult to pinpoint without a color analysis tool, but it appears to be a medium-toned, saturated blue.
*   **Clarity and Focus:** The image has a slight soft focus. This contributes to the subtle glow of the white "S" against the blue backdrop.

**Interpretation:**

The image is a simple representation of the letter "S" in a visually clean and modern aesthetic. It could be used as a logo, a placeholder, or simply an abstract image.
 Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content Description:**

The image features a single capital letter "S" rendered in white with a slight blurred effect. The background is a solid, bright blue color. 

**Key Features:**

*   **Letter:** The prominent element is the letter "S".
*   **Color:** The "S" is white. The background is bright blue.
*   **Blur:** The "S" has a slight blurred effect, giving it a soft appearance.
*   **Minimalist Design:** The overall design is simple and minimalist, focusing on a single letter against a clean background.

> I was successful in getting the hash in js.

I was thinking of same solution it would definetly work in js.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image depicts a person, likely a young man, captured in a low-light environment with a noticeable green color cast. The subject appears to be in motion or caught in a candid moment.

**Subject:**

*   **Gender:** Likely male.
*   **Appearance:** He has short dark hair, a beard, and appears to be wearing dark clothing. His expression is partially obscured, but his mouth is open, suggesting he might be speaking or in some form of expression.
*   **Orientation:** The subject is facing toward the left of the frame, viewed in a partial side profile.

**Lighting and Color:**

*   **Low Light:** The scene is dimly lit, with most of the details in shadow.
*   **Green Color Cast:** A significant portion of the image is bathed in green light, originating from an unseen source. This green hue dominates the scene and affects the subject's complexion and clothing.

**Background:**

*   **Dark/Undefined:** The background is dark and lacks distinct features, making it difficult to discern any specific details. It appears to be a dark or obscured area, possibly a wall or another indistinct surface.

**Overall Impression:**

The image conveys a sense of being captured in a moment, with the lighting and color contributing to an atmospheric or possibly edgy feel. The low light and green cast could be intentional artistic choices or simply the result of the environment the photo was taken in.

Okay. Thank you sir. I’ll just do this after the rest for now.

Another question .. In GA1 Q6, will the hidden element be sent as an html file or will the tag be included in the question parameter?

@carlton and @jivraj,

Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..

I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you.

I too want to know like by 5 questions at random, is it 1 random question per GA or 5 random questions from the entire 5 GAs?

In the later case, there would be no certainty unless all of our questions works and there aren’t any unexpected surprises at the evaluation.

in the GA 4 question 5 ( Find the bounding box of a city ) Will the OSM\_id ending digits be provided. In the question body they are not there but on submission they come like in the attached screenshot.  

image1614×372 45 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content Overview:**

The image presents information about the impact of using UrbanRide for automating the extraction and processing of bounding box data. It then poses a question about the minimum latitude of the bounding box of Tianjin, China, as found on the Nominatim API. The user has entered a value, which is flagged as incorrect.

**Text Breakdown:**

*   **Title:** "Impact"
*   **Introductory Text:** "By automating the extraction and processing of bounding box data, UrbanRide can:"
*   **Impact Points (Bulleted List):**
    *   "Optimize Routing: Enhance route planning algorithms with precise geographical boundaries, reducing delivery times and operational costs."
    *   "Improve Fleet Allocation: Allocate vehicles more effectively across defined service zones based on accurate city extents."
    *   "Enhance Market Analysis: Gain deeper insights into regional performance, enabling targeted marketing and service improvements."
    *   "Scale Operations: Seamlessly integrate new cities into their service network with minimal manual intervention, ensuring consistent data quality."
*   **Question:** "What is the minimum latitude of the bounding box of the city Tianjin in the country China on the Nominatim API? Value of the minimum latitude"
*   **User Input Field:** Contains the value "38.566"
*   **Error Message:** "Error: Incorrect latitude. Check OSM ID ending with 2077"

**Visual Features:**

*   The overall presentation is clean, with clear text.
*   The "Impact" points are formatted as a bulleted list, making them easy to read.
*   There is an input field provided for the user to type in their answer.
*   A red border and error icon indicate that the user's answer is incorrect.

**Key Information:**

The main takeaway is that the image is part of an interactive system where the user is being asked to find data (minimum latitude for Tianjin using Nominatim API) and their answer is being checked for correctness. The error message provides a hint to check an OSM ID.

I faced the same issue. Initially, I used `geopy.geocoders` to solve the question, and it provided the correct answer during the assignment submission. However, the same approach is now giving an incorrect result.

Instead of using `geopy`, try using this URL directly: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search .  
This worked for me.

1. I have a doubt like when I pass answers in string and in the questions about markdown will the \n characters be properly parsed before checking the correctness of the markdown or will it be directly checked for valid markdown? Because the raw string when pasted in the text box of the GA isn’t getting the markdown.
2. In case of image compression question, should I return the base64 encoding of the compressed image?

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
**Respected TDS Team,**

I currently have Three doubts regarding **Project 2**:

1. As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I’m attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1—one is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.  

   mydata939×401 18.3 KB

     

   friend data938×465 20.5 KB

     
   During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.
2. In **GA4 Q2**, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe.  

   image1674×420 24.3 KB

     

   image1118×358 63.7 KB

     
   Please check the issue in the images provided. How to handle this question.
3. In **GA4 Q10**, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, @carlton sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.  
   Here is the thread link for reference.  
   How should we handle this question now?

Thankyou
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a table, likely from a spreadsheet program like Excel. It has columns with headers and rows containing data. The table represents transaction information, probably related to sales.

**Columns and Headers:**

*   **TransactionID:** Numerical identifier for each transaction (e.g., 0001, 0002, 0003, and so on).

*   **Customer Name:** Name of the customer involved in the transaction (e.g., John Doe, Frank Thomas, Bob Brown, Charlie Davis, Alice Johnson, Eve Wilson).

*   **Country:** Country associated with the customer or the transaction (e.g., France, United States, FRA, IND, United Arab Emirates, US, AE, U.A.E, United Kingdom, FR, FRA, UAE). Note that the representation of country names appears to be abbreviated and potentially inconsistent (e.g., FRA vs. France, U.A.E vs. United Arab Emirates).

*   **Date:** Date of the transaction (e.g., 10-13-2023, 2022/10/14, 09-06-2023, 01-27-2022). There are various date formats used, including month-day-year and year/month/day.

*   **Product/Code:** Name or code identifying the product involved in the transaction (e.g., Eta/fzflrq, Alpha/f2yscp, Theta/xvwf8u, Zeta/4rk2rx, Theta/0ylj7e, Kappa/bquhwf, Iota/0t6cym, Gamma/mb4cm9, Iota/vhfsw5, Kappa/yyzmfh, Alpha/ixogpm, Beta/py2nmk, Epsilon/vl58sf, Zeta/dljl2j). The format appears to be `Product Name/Product Code`.

*   **Sales:** The Sales amount for the transaction, specified with USD as a currency code.

*   **Cost:** The Cost amount for the transaction, specified with USD as a currency code.

**Data Rows:**

Each row represents a separate transaction, with specific values populated for each column.

**Key Observations and Potential Issues:**

*   **Inconsistent Country Codes:** The use of both full country names (e.g., France, United States) and abbreviations (e.g., FRA, IND, AE, U.A.E.) makes analysis more difficult.  Standardization would be beneficial.
*   **Date Format Variation:** Multiple date formats are used. Using a single, consistent format would be preferable for data analysis.
*   **USD is included with the sales/cost data**, to perform numerical computations, it needs to be removed.
 Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image is a table representing transactional data. It has several columns detailing information about each transaction. The table headers are:

*   **TransactionID:** A unique identifier for each transaction.
*   **Customer Name:** The name of the customer who made the transaction.
*   **Country:** The country of the customer.
*   **Date:** The date on which the transaction occurred.
*   **Product/Code:**  A combination of product name and/or code.
*   **Sales:**  The sales amount for the transaction.
*   **Cost:** The cost associated with the transaction.

**Data Rows (Examples):**

*   **Row 1:** TransactionID 0001, Customer Name Frank Thomas, Country IND, Date 12-01-2022, Product/Code Delta/tbakf3, Sales 7164 USD, Cost 2062 USD
*   **Row 2:** TransactionID 0002, Customer Name Eve Wilson, Country US, Date 08-10-2023, Product/Code Alpha/hknae9, Sales 2457 USD, Cost 3439 USD
*   **Row 17:** TransactionID 0017, Customer Name Alice Johnson, Country Bra, Date 2023/01/09, Product/Code Alpha/Ifxdg5, Sales 9914 USD, Cost 415 USD

**Key Features/Observations:**

*   The "Country" column has abbreviations/acronyms (e.g., IND, US, AE, U.K) and full country names (e.g., United Kingdom).
*   The "Date" column appears to have varying formats (e.g., 12-01-2022, 2022/09/04).
*   Sales and cost are provided in USD.
*   There are multiple transactions for some customers, like John Doe and Alice Johnson.

In essence, the image presents a transactional database with information on customers, their location, dates of purchase, products purchased, sales amounts, and costs.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:** The image shows a question about JSON data, a box containing the JSON data, an error message, a warning about IMDb search results, and a "Check" button.

**Text elements:**

*   **"What is the JSON data?"** - This is the main question.
*   **JSON Data:**
    *   `"id": "tt30422937",`
    *   `"title": "6. Nadaaniyan",`
    *   `"year": "2025",`
    *   `"rating": "3.0"`
*   **Error Message:** "Error: At \[5] title: Values don't match. Expected: "6. Naadaniyaan". Actual: "6. Nadanian"
*   **Warning:** "IMDb search results may differ by region. You may need to manually translate titles. Results may also change periodically. You may need to re-run your scraper code."
*   **"Check"** - A button, likely used for submitting an answer.

**Visual elements:**

*   A red-bordered box containing the JSON data. This highlights the code the user is being asked about.
*   The "Check" button is blue, indicating it is interactive.

**Meaning/Interpretation:**

The user is being asked to provide or validate JSON data. The data includes a movie ID, title, year, and rating. An error message suggests that there's a discrepancy in the "title" field between what was expected and what was provided in the JSON data. The warning indicates that IMDb search results and titles might vary, so some manual translation might be needed or the scraper code might need to be re-run.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Top Section:**
*   There's a line of text that reads, "An FBI agent and Florida State officer team up to investigate a string of unsolved murder cases." This likely describes the plot of a movie or TV show.

**Main Section (Item 6):**
*   There's a list item numbered "6" with the title "Nadaaniyan".
*   Below the title, there's information that reads:
    *   "2025" (likely the release year)
    *   "1h 59m" (likely the duration)
    *   "TV-14" (a content rating)
*   There's a star rating of "3.0 (14K)" and a clickable "Rate" link.
*   A plot summary is present: "A privileged Delhi socialite hires a middle-class student to pose as her boyfriend to maintain her social status. Their pretense becomes complicated when genuine feelings develop between them."
* There is a movie poster image to the left.

**Bottom Section (Item 7):**
* There is a list item numbered "7" with the title "Watson."
* The item is cropped.

**Other Elements:**

*   There are some dropdown arrows on the left side.
*   There is a small information icon on the right side.

In summary, the image seems to be a list of movies or TV shows with descriptions, ratings, and release information. One listing is titled "Nadaaniyan" and involves a plot about a socialite hiring a student as a fake boyfriend.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:** The image shows a close-up of Will Smith's face. He has a mustache, and he's wearing what appears to be a suit and a white shirt with a collar. His expression is neutral or slightly serious, with a direct gaze towards the viewer. The background is a soft, out-of-focus white or light grey. There is no text present in the image.

**Key Features:**

*   **Subject:** Will Smith is the primary subject.
*   **Facial Features:** The presence of the mustache is a notable detail.
*   **Attire:** The suit and white shirt suggest a formal or professional setting.
*   **Expression:** The somewhat serious expression might hint at the mood or context of the image.
*   **Background:** The plain background focuses attention on Smith's face.

This information could be useful for identifying the specific movie, TV show, or context this image is from, especially if combined with knowledge about Will Smith's filmography or roles where he sported a mustache.

Hi @23f2003751

### Short Answer: No

### Long Answer:

Backslashes are usually not a problem when converting a string to JSON. But somehow the evaluation script isn’t taking this into consideration. Check this out.  
This is my response  

image1113×125 3.01 KB

which is shown incorrect just after adding 2 backslashes

image1107×122 4.01 KB
---------------------

### Note: It would be better to check your responses on the TDS portal before finalising the script. You can access the answer box and check button by removing the disable attribute.
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image depicts a text block within a dark-themed user interface.
*   The text block shows JSON data alongside text labels "Sorted JSON:" and "Correct".

**Textual Content:**

*   **"Sorted JSON:"**: This is the title or label for the section containing the JSON data.
*   **JSON Data**: There is JSON data that appears to be a list of objects with each object containing the attributes of name and age.  It seems the data is presented in a single line.
    *   Example objects: `{"name": "Bob", "age": 11}`, `{"name": "Emma", "age": 11}`, `{"name": "Grace", "age": 14}`.
*   **"Correct"**: This text appears below the JSON and suggests that the displayed JSON is considered correct in the context of the interface or task.

**Other Features:**

*   A green checkmark indicates that the sorted JSON is correct
*   The JSON is contained within a light green outlined box

**In summary, the image presents an interface element showing a sorted JSON data set, and it is indicated as being correct within the system.**
 The image shows a text display with the label "Sorted JSON:" at the top, followed by a JSON array enclosed in square brackets. Inside the array, there are several JSON objects, each containing "name" and "age" properties with respective values. However, the JSON structure appears to be incomplete or malformed, as the error message "SyntaxError: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 16 (line 1 column 17)" is displayed below the JSON array, indicating an issue with the JSON syntax. The issue likely stems from the usage of forward slashes to escape the double quotes surrounding "name" in the first object.

@Saransh\_Saini

it can’t be fixed actually, you would need the answer in the json format

`{"answer": "actual_answer"}`

but if the actual\_answer needs to be string and if it happens to be of json type, it has to be represented using `\"`

I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe.

Questions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal.

Same as above.

How to parameterise this function? It is really difficult to do this function with other parameter, please help. what is approach other than hardcoding it?
The image shows a Python script designed to access Google Colab with required email access. The email address associated with the script is "23f1001524@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."

The script imports necessary libraries like `hashlib`, `requests`, `auth` from `google.colab`, and `GoogleCredentials` from `oauth2client.client`.

It then authenticates the user using `auth.authenticate_user()`, retrieves Google credentials using `GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()`, and obtains an access token.

A request is made to the Google API to retrieve user information using the access token, specifically targeting the "email" field in the JSON response.

Finally, the script calculates a SHA256 hash of a string combining the email address and the expiry year of the credentials. It then extracts the last 5 characters of the hexadecimal representation of the hash.

The image concludes with a question: "What is the result? (It should be a 5-character string)".

Did you get a solution for the Markdown question? I have the same issue.

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh\_Saini  

image892×388 18 KB

  
Can we rather do PlainTextResponse for the markdown question?
Here's a detailed description of the image's content, focusing on the text and layout:

**Overall Structure:**

The image presents a document, likely a report, focused on step analysis. It is structured with clear headings and subheadings. The document appears to be in a code-like format (possibly Markdown) as evidenced by the '#' symbols for headings and the use of backticks.

**Key Sections and Content:**

1.  **Title:** "# Step Analysis Report"
2.  **Introduction:** A brief description of the report's purpose, explaining that it examines daily step counts, compares them over time, and was collected using a fitness tracker. Key actions included comparing daily steps with previous weeks and analyzing trends with friends.
3.  **Data Collection:**
    *   Data was logged into a spreadsheet.
    *   Weekly trends were calculated.
4.  **Data Table:** A table format showing steps walked:
    *   Thursday: 10,000 steps
    *   Monday: 8,500 steps
    *   Friday: 9,600 steps
5.  **Code for Step Analysis:**
    *   States that Python was used for the analysis.
    *   Shows a snippet of code:
        *   `['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']`
        *   `df = pd.DataFrame(data)`
        *   `print(df.describe())`
6.  **Observations:**
    *   "The highest step count was recorded on **Sunday**."
    *   "There was a general"
7.  **Comparison with Friends:**
    *   Quote: "> \"Walking together keeps us motivated!\" - A friend from the study group."
    *   Alice: **10,500** steps/day average
    *   Bob: **9,800** steps/day average
8.  **Improvements:**  Some ways to improve step count tracking:
    *   **Increase daily goals**
    *   Track steps using an advanced fitness tracker
9.  **Reference:**  Provides a URL to a healthline article: https://www.healthline.com/health/how-many-steps-a-day
10. **Visualization:** The image contains the beginning of an image tag `![`, which suggests an intention to display a visualization.

**Formatting and Style:**

*   **Headings:** The document uses "#" to denote main headings and "##" for subheadings.
*   **Emphasis:** Certain words or phrases are emphasized using double asterisks (\*\*) for bolding.
*   **Lists:** Some sections use bullet points for listing items.
*   **Markdown:** The formatting strongly suggests that the original source is a Markdown file, which is a lightweight markup language that's easy to read and write, commonly used for reports, documentation, and notes.

**Overall Impression:**

The image presents a well-structured and concise report on step analysis.  It includes data, code, observations, and actionable recommendations.

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh\_Saini

Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday’s Session)
========================================================================================================

Respected TDS Team,

As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following @Saransh’s suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.

---

Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. GA3 Q8

   * Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.
2. GA3 Q9

   * Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY\_TOKEN.
   * Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?
3. GA4 Q2 & Q10

   * Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.
   * Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution
4. Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)

   * Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\n) and backslashes are added.
   * Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.
5. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions

   * Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a \*\*live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.
   * Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?

---

Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:

1. Platform Capability for GA Tasks

   * Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?
   * Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.
2. File Upload Example via Platform API

   * Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.
   * This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.
3. General Observations on GA1-5  
   Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.

---

Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.
Here is a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Overall Impression:**

The image features a single, prominent, red exclamation mark against a solid black background. The exclamation mark is stylized with a slight 3D or pixelated effect, giving it a somewhat retro or digital appearance.

**Detailed Description:**

*   **Object:** A red exclamation mark.
*   **Color:** The exclamation mark is a vivid red color. It has a slight gradient, with a lighter red or glossy highlight on the top portion, giving it a bit of depth.
*   **Shape/Style:** The exclamation mark is rectangular for the upper portion and has a rounded dot at the bottom. The edges are slightly pixelated, contributing to the stylized effect.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid black color. This stark contrast makes the red exclamation mark stand out significantly.

**Possible Interpretations:**

Given the simplicity of the image, the exclamation mark could signify:

*   **Warning:** Used to draw attention to a potential hazard or problem.
*   **Emphasis:** Meant to emphasize a point or make something seem important.
*   **Surprise/Excitement:** Indicating a sense of astonishment or enthusiasm.
*   **Attention:** Simply serving as a visual cue to grab the viewer's attention.

@carlton ( @Saransh\_Saini ) @Jivraj , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like **need**

**Summary: Please extend Project 2 deadline by 2 days(April 1st),**  
*(actually 1 day extension is April 1st)*

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/110](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/110)

Hi @23f1002382 ,  
Unfortunately it’s not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.

All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image displays a single element against a black background:

*   **Object:** A hand making the "Victory" or "Peace" sign. The hand is depicted in a yellow color, suggesting a skin tone representation.
*   **Gesture:** The hand is forming the "V" gesture, where the index and middle fingers are extended upwards, and the other fingers are curled into the palm. This gesture is commonly recognized as symbolizing "Victory," "Peace," or the number "2."
*   **Background:** The background is uniformly black, which helps to highlight the hand and the gesture.

**Relevant Features:**

*   The gesture itself is the most prominent feature. Its cultural significance will be crucial for interpreting the image's meaning.
*   The color of the hand suggests it is meant to represent a human hand.
*   The black background helps isolate the subject and emphasizes its importance.

**Possible Interpretations and Uses:**

The image could be used to express feelings of:

*   **Triumph or success:** Indicating someone has achieved a goal.
*   **Hope for peace:** Symbolizing a desire for an end to conflict.
*   **A greeting or farewell:** In some contexts, this gesture can simply be a friendly acknowledgment.
*   **Representing the number two.**

@21f2000709 @23f2003751  
Yes you are absolutely right. I confirmed this with Carlton and Anand sir, and yes you have to send the JSON responses as strings, which will automatically add those backslashes(\). I apologies for causing this confusion, and I hope I was able to clarify it.

Hi @21f3001993  
You can use the `zipfile` library to extract and access zip files pretty easily. You can even make it so that you don’t even have to download the sent file either zip/csv/etc, in order to access it. All this will be discussed in Thurday’s [27-03-2025] Live Session. Kindly attend the session if you want a deeper understanding of it.

just to clarify if the llm is giving the output like this the evaluation script will mark it correct.

```
{
 "answer": "[{\"name\":\"Charlie\",\"age\":16},{\"name\":\"Liam\",\"age\":23},{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"age\":28},{\"name\":\"Grace\",\"age\":36},{\"name\":\"Ivy\",\"age\":44},{\"name\":\"Jack\",\"age\":53},{\"name\":\"David\",\"age\":56},{\"name\":\"Oscar\",\"age\":57},{\"name\":\"Karen\",\"age\":65},{\"name\":\"Frank\",\"age\":67},{\"name\":\"Nora\",\"age\":68},{\"name\":\"Emma\",\"age\":70},{\"name\":\"Paul\",\"age\":88},{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":92},{\"name\":\"Henry\",\"age\":94},{\"name\":\"Mary\",\"age\":97}]"

Yes, it will. Just make sure that doing a json.loads() on this string should give you the desired output.

The GA portal marks it as wrong unless I manually insert new lines. I hope that won’t be an issue, will it?

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/122](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/122)

Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.

Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.

The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists.

The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually)

To check if a string has invisible characters,

```
# Multi-line string
my_string = """Hello
World    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	"""

# Print ASCII values of each character
print([ord(c) for c in my_string])

```

e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9

This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response,

```
import requests
import json

# This is just an example server to see what we see.

url = "https://httpbin.org/post"

my_multiline_string_answer = """This is a multiline
string that spans
multiple lines    with    spaces 
and some newlines
and a tab	as well."""

response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": my_multiline_string_answer
}

# Send the JSON data
response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

# Check the response
print (response.status_code)
print (response.json ())
print (response.text)

# Do other checks as necessary... 

```

See what happens when I print the result

```
print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```

Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 1.09.56 pm323×120 3.61 KB

Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.

Here is a json example:

```
json_answer = {
    "mary": "poppins",
    "age": 42
}

stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)
response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": stringed_json
}

response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])

```

Look at the response. A perfect json.

If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.

Kind regards
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of a terminal window, likely on a macOS system. It shows command-line interactions and the output of a Python script.

**Textual Content:**

The terminal prompt appears twice, indicating the start of a new command line:

*   `.venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %`

The first command executed appears to be:

*   `/User tds/test.py`

This suggests the user is attempting to run a Python script named `test.py` located within the `tds` directory in their `User` directory.

The output of the Python script is the following multiline string:

*   `This is a multiline`
*   `string that spans`
*   `multiple lines with spaces`
*   `and some newlines`
*   `and a tab as well.`

**Objects and Features:**

*   **Terminal Prompt:** The user prompt includes the username (`venvcarland`), the hostname (`Carlton-MacBook-Pro`), and the current directory (`tds`). The `%` symbol typically indicates the user is not root.
*   **Color Scheme:** The terminal uses a dark background (probably a dark blue or cyan) with light-colored text. This is a common setup for terminals to improve readability.
*   **Python Script:** The script `test.py` seems to output a string that explicitly demonstrates multiline capabilities.
*   **Symbol**: there are some filled dots at the beginning of each prompt line.
 Here's a description of the image's content:

The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or command-line interface. We see text, specifically:

*   `.venvcarland@Carlton-MacBook-Pro tds %` (this is likely the command prompt)
*   `tds/test.py` (this indicates a file path, possibly a Python script)
*   `{"mary": "poppins", "age": 42}` (This is a JSON-like string, representing a dictionary with keys "mary" and "age" and corresponding values "poppins" and 42)

The command prompt appears twice, once at the top and again at the bottom of the image. The JSON string sits between the file path and the second command prompt.

I would request the TDS team to please consider making the evaluation criteria for project 2 a bit more liberal.  
5 random Questions with 4 marks each is quite harsh. I request you to make it more balanced like 2 Qs from each GA with 2 marks each or so. So that even if we can’t exhaustively cover the whole number of questions, it gives mercy for the partial completion.

5 random question is a kind of lottery or luck based unless our app is perfect. Thanks

1. **GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages**

* As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address `21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.
* To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.
* However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a **502 Bad Gateway** error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration.

2. **GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files**

* A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a **502 Bad Gateway** error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.
* Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.

Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

Below Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.

image1854×493 55.9 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Left Side (Request/Response)**

*   **Request URL:**  `http://127.0.0.1:1000/api`
*   **Server Response:**
    *   **Code:** 200 (This is an HTTP status code indicating success)
    *   **Response Body:** A JSON response: `{"answer": "https://2113001076.github.io/github-pages-20250327144836/"}`
    *   **Download Button:** There's a button labeled "Download" (presumably to download the response body).
    *   **Response Headers:** There are some response headers visible (access-control-allow-credentials, access-control-allow-origin, content-length, content-type, date, and server) but their exact values are cut off.

**Right Side (Instructions/Context)**

*   **GitHub Pages and Cloudflare:**  It states that GitHub Pages are served via Cloudflare, which obfuscates email addresses.  It shows how to obfuscate an email address inside some tags, although the details are partly obscured.
*   **GitHub Pages URL Question:**
    *   It asks: "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`"
    *   **Correct Answer:**  `https://2113001076.github.io/github-pages-20250327144836`
    *   There is a green checkmark next to the correct answer, indicating it's been validated.
*   **Cache Busting:** Mentions that if recent changes are not reflected, adding `?v=2, ?v=3` to the URL can bust the cache.

**Overall Interpretation**

The image shows a web application testing or learning environment.  The left side displays an API request and its response, including the URL of a GitHub Pages site. The right side provides instructions or guidance about GitHub Pages URLs, including their structure and how to force a cache refresh.  The user has correctly identified the GitHub Pages URL based on the instructions and/or API response.

### **Final Thoughts on Project 2**

Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.

1. **Organization & Structure:**  
   The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.
2. **Deployment & Portal Limitations:**  
   There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.
3. **Time Constraints:**  
   Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.
4. **Sessions & Support:**  
   The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.
5. **Deployment Variability:**  
   Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.
6. **Effort Acknowledgment:**  
   I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.
7. **Feasibility in the Given Timeline:**  
   Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.

---

I genuinely hope someone is able to complete **all 57 questions** successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.

Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

**Thank you for the learning opportunity**

If there is any plan for extension, I request the TDS team to announce it in advance as people would rush and submit, then, they come hear about the extension when they had submitted it already.

Happened to me like almost every time. We have OPPE this weekend, so if there is slightest possibility, I request to announce it in advance.

@Saransh\_Saini @carlton  
Can someone reply to this?
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows an emoji. It's a yellow face with a bright smile. The eyes are closed in a slightly squished, happy expression. The mouth is wide open, showing a pink tongue and white teeth. A single blue droplet of sweat is visible on the right side of the face, near the forehead.

**Key Features:**

*   **Yellow Face:** The base of the emoji is a standard yellow color.
*   **Smiling Expression:** The wide smile and closed eyes indicate happiness.
*   **Sweat Droplet:** The presence of the blue sweat droplet adds an element of nervousness, awkwardness, or relieved anxiety to the expression. It suggests the smile is not entirely carefree, potentially indicating a situation where the person is feeling pressured or slightly overwhelmed.

Dear Sirs,

I have a question regarding Q3 and Q4 of GA5. When calling the API, should we pass the `.gz` file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the `.gz` file?

Specifically, will the API call be structured as follows?

Essentialy, will the API call look like so?

> curl -X POST “http://127.0.0.1:5000”   
> -H “Content-Type: multipart/form-data”   
> -F "question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents - anand.net is a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site’s key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server’s Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site s-anand.net in May 2024. Each row has these fields:

> Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‘-’.  
> Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‘-’.  
> Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this.  
> Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts:

so I have a doubt whatever output my code gives for the ga question , if i copy it one to one and paste in the ga page and it says correct .Would it mean the same would happen with the evaluation method ? or is there any extra things i must add?  
{  
“answer” : “answer inside string”  
}

> 2. **GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files**
>
> * A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a **502 Bad Gateway** error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.
> * Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.

@carlton  
I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.  
How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help.

@s.anand  
@carlton @Jivraj  
Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.  
It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.

I believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.
Here's a detailed description of the image based on my analysis:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a medium shot of a man, likely a professional headshot. He is wearing a suit jacket, and a light-colored shirt, likely white. He has a neutral expression. The background is a plain, light color, possibly off-white or light gray.

**Specific Features:**

*   **Subject:** The man is the main focus. He appears to be in his late 20s to mid-30s. He has short, dark hair and a well-groomed beard.
*   **Attire:** He is wearing a dark suit jacket (appears to be black or dark gray). Underneath the jacket, he wears a light-colored button-down shirt, likely white.
*   **Facial Features:** He has a slight smile or a neutral expression. His features appear symmetrical and well-proportioned.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid, light color (possibly white or light gray). It's simple and doesn't distract from the subject.
*   **Composition:** The image is well-composed, with the man centered in the frame. The lighting is even and flattering.
*   **Quality:** The image seems to have good resolution.

**Possible Interpretations:**

*   The image is likely a professional headshot for business use, such as a LinkedIn profile or company website.
*   The man is likely in a professional field.

If you have specific questions about the image, feel free to ask!

Hello sir,

My question is, the questions my endpoint will be evaluated are they the exact same ones with same parameters for my respective email as on the assignment portal ?

Essentially I am trying to understand there are certain questions where I don’t have to solve the question again and just return the hardcoded answers, would that be correct ?

Anyone please respond and also for ga 1 q 8 for instance where we have:

Let’s make sure you know how to use JSON. Sort this JSON array of objects by the value of the `age` field. In case of a tie, sort by the `name` field. Paste the resulting JSON below without any spaces or newlines.

```
[{"name":"Alice","age":67},{"name":"Bob","age":53},{"name":"Charlie","age":34},{"name":"David","age":89},{"name":"Emma","age":92},{"name":"Frank","age":37},{"name":"Grace","age":4},{"name":"Henry","age":49},{"name":"Ivy","age":30},{"name":"Jack","age":2},{"name":"Karen","age":2},{"name":"Liam","age":5},{"name":"Mary","age":32},{"name":"Nora","age":56},{"name":"Oscar","age":19},{"name":"Paul","age":22}]

```

Sorted JSON:

here would question be sent as text only or text + json file seperately?

Hi @adi3,  
The `.gz` file would be sent along with the API request. You can even read the file directly without even downloading it.

The API request would be sent containing the question text and the JSON file/files as a binary stream.

Hi @22f3002933  
Files are less likely to change, but parameters are. For instance, GA1\_Q12, the zip file is less likely to change but the symbols to perform the aggregate on would be changed.

Hi @lakshaygarg654,  
Yes for GA4\_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request.  
Unfortunately, we can’t extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done.

Thanks for the answer sir.

I remember being told on the last session, that the question will be exactly the same we have on the assignment portal for my respective case, and the answer on the portal can be the same here as well.

Actually I am exploring a hardcoded answer route where if i return the answer which I already got after solving the questions on the portal (in certain qns with dynamic functions) , so thought of asking if method is alright.

Yes sending your GA answer as text as the JSON response can work if the question was not parameterized. I hope you are aware that parameters for some questions will be changed, resulting in different answers.

Thanks for your reply @Saransh\_Saini  
I’ve figured out the solution to that particular question.  
The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions—similar to the project 1 workflow—and This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva’s and oppe’s )  
Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it.

Hi @Saransh\_Saini @carlton ,

In the sample curl command  
i.e.

```
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip"

```

It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well,  
But still can you please confirm if there will be only one file or there can be multiple files send to API?

Multiple files can be sent in the API requestion. They would be sent as a list of files.

Hello Sir,

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using `vicky_server.py`, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. `My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.`

However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem?

Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes `first.py` for GA1.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!

Best regards,  
vicky kumar

@carlton  
I am bit confused about answer evaluation process. Can you tell which one is correct process.  
1st process ( I used json.dumps() to get my\_response as json formatted string)  

image726×224 4.68 KB

2nd process ( This one is Json object)  

image514×193 3.61 KB

or both are incorrect?

This is one more example of 1st process after json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:  

image927×466 20.8 KB

This is one more example of 2nd process without use of json.loads() it gave me correct format for assignment portal answer:  

image984×476 19.7 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Code Snippet:**

*   **`import json`**: Imports the JSON library, which is used for working with JSON data.
*   **`my_response = "{\\"answer\\": \\"26272\\"}"`**: This line defines a string variable named `my_response`. The string represents a JSON object. Notice the backslashes `\` are used to escape the double quotes `"` within the string. This is necessary to create a valid string literal in Python.
*   **`print(json.loads(my_response)["answer"])`**:
    *   **`json.loads(my_response)`**: This part uses the `json.loads()` function to parse the JSON string stored in `my_response` into a Python dictionary.
    *   **`["answer"]`**: After parsing, this part accesses the value associated with the key "answer" in the newly created Python dictionary.
    *   **`print(...)`**: Finally, the `print()` function displays the value extracted from the dictionary.

**Output:**

*   **`26272`**: This indicates that the code executed successfully, and the value associated with the key "answer" (which is the string "26272") was printed to the console.

**Overall:**

The code demonstrates how to read a JSON string, parse it into a Python dictionary, and then extract a specific value from that dictionary. The output confirms that the value "26272" was successfully extracted.
 The image displays Python code along with its output.

- **Code:** The code begins with `import json`, suggesting the intent to work with JSON data, though it's not explicitly used in the shown snippet.  A dictionary named `my_response` is created, containing a single key-value pair: "answer" with the value "26272" (a string).  Finally, the `print()` function is used to access and display the value associated with the "answer" key from the `my_response` dictionary.

- **Output:** Below the code, "26272" is printed to the console, indicating that the code successfully accessed the dictionary value.

- **Overall:** The image demonstrates basic dictionary access in Python.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the code snippet:

**Overall Structure:**

The image shows a Python code snippet. The code seems to be designed for interacting with the OpenAI API to perform sentiment analysis on a given text. The code block defines a string variable called `my_response` which contains valid JSON code, which is the main bulk of the script.

**Code Breakdown:**

1.  **Imports:**
    *   `import json`:  Imports the `json` module, which is used for working with JSON data.

2.  **my_response String:**
    *   `my_response = "..."`: This is the core of the example. It's a string that's intended to be interpreted as Python code that will use the `httpx` package to send a POST request to the OpenAI API and then print the result.
    *   **Inside the String:**
        *   `import httpx`: Imports the `httpx` library to make HTTP requests.
        *   `def analyze_sentiment():`: Defines a function named `analyze_sentiment`.
        *   `url = ...`:  Sets the URL for the OpenAI Chat Completions API.
        *   `headers = ...`: Defines the headers for the HTTP request:
            *   `Authorization`:  Contains a placeholder API key ("Bearer dummy\_api\_key").  **Important:**  This should be replaced with a real API key for the code to work.
            *   `Content-Type`: Specifies that the request body will be in JSON format.
        *   `data = ...`:  Constructs a JSON payload containing the data for the API request:
            *   `model`: Sets the model to "gpt-4o-mini".
            *   `messages`:  An array of messages used as input for the language model:
                *   `role: system`: The "system" message provides instructions to the AI (to analyze sentiment).
                *   `role: user`: The "user" message provides the actual text to analyze ("P5I 3P1xw aE WvYHB6zc5xB SY4QzV 0bM8tDP7e o MOG4R9").
        *   `response = httpx.post(...)`: Sends a POST request to the OpenAI API.
        *   `raise_for_status()`: Raises an exception if the HTTP request fails (status code not in the 200-300 range).
        *   `result = response.json()`: Parses the JSON response from the API.
        *   `return result`: Returns the parsed JSON result.
        *   `if __name__ == "__main__":`: Checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).
        *   `try...except`:  Handles potential exceptions:
            *   `sentiment_result = analyze_sentiment()`: Calls the `analyze_sentiment` function.
            *   `print(sentiment_result)`: Prints the sentiment analysis result.
            *   `except Exception as e: print(...)`: If an error occurs, prints an error message.

3.  **print(json.loads(my\_response)\["answer"\]):**

    *   This line at the end of the script parses the JSON string stored in the `my_response` variable, accesses the value associated with the key `"answer"`, and then prints that value to the console.

**Key Observations and Potential Issues:**

*   **API Key:** The code uses a placeholder API key (`dummy_api_key`). This needs to be replaced with a valid OpenAI API key for the code to function correctly.
*   **String Encoding:** The string `my_response` contains a lot of escaped backslashes (`\\`). This is necessary to properly encode the special characters (like quotes and newline characters) within the string.
*   **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block provides basic error handling.
*   **Purpose:** This code shows how to use the OpenAI API to get sentiment analysis results from a given text input.
*   The JSON string is complex and might be better represented as a Python dictionary before conversion to JSON string.

In essence, the image shows an attempt to create a program that gets sentiment analysis from the OpenAI API, however the author has stored the main code in a JSON string and then retrieves it at the end of the program to try and run it.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image displays code, likely a Python script.
*   The code appears to define a JSON object named `my_response` that contains the definition of a function meant to analyze text using an API.
*   The script then attempts to print the contents of the `answer` key within the `my_response` JSON object.

**Key Code Elements (from the OCR)**

1.  **Imports:**

    *   `import json` -  Used for handling JSON data.
2.  **JSON Object `my_response`:**

    *   It's a dictionary-like object in Python, represented as `my_response = { ... }`.
    *   It has a key called "answer".
    *   The value associated with the "answer" key is a long string that looks like a Python code snippet. The `\n` likely represent newline characters to structure the code.
3.  **Code Snippet inside `"answer"`:**

    *   `import httpx`
    *   Defines a function called `analyze_sentiment()`.
    *   `url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"`: Specifies the API endpoint.
    *   `headers`: Includes `Authorization` (Bearer token) and `Content-Type` (application/json).
    *   `data`: Contains the `model` (gpt-4o-mini), and `messages` which includes `role` for both system (defines the goal of the model) and user (the content to be analyzed).
    *   Uses `httpx.post` to make a request to the API, handling response and raising exception with `response.raise_for_status()`.
    *   The function is trying to get JSON results from the API (`response.json()`).
    *   `if __name__ == "__main__":` - Executes only when the script is run directly.
    *   `try...except` block: Attempts to run `analyze_sentiment()` and prints any errors if they occur.
4.  **Final Print Statement:**

    *   `print(my_response["answer"])`: This line attempts to access the value of the "answer" key in the `my_response` dictionary and print it. This will likely print the long string containing the code snippet.

**Likely Issue:**

*   The code within the `"answer"` key is not properly executed; it is just a string. The script prints the string, not the result of the code within the string.

In summary, the image shows Python code attempting to interact with the OpenAI API to perform sentiment analysis. The script defines a function for this purpose, stores it as a string within a JSON-like structure, and then attempts to print that string.

I am trying to create a student account on Microsoft Azure using my IIT Madras email ID (**23f2004705@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**), but I am encountering an issue. The system is showing a message that my email domain is not currently registered with them, and it is asking me to use another verification method.

@carlton @Jivraj Could you please guide me on how to proceed with the verification or if there is an alternative method to access Azure’s student benefits?  

Screenshot 2025-03-29 1458011891×451 158 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a Microsoft Azure web page related to academic verification.

**Elements:**

*   **Top Navigation Bar:**
    *   The Microsoft Azure logo is on the left side.
    *   An email address ("23l2004705@ds.study.itm.ac.in") and a "Sign out" link are positioned on the right side.
*   **Warning Message:**
    *   A notification box indicates that "Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method."
*   **Academic Verification Section:**
    *   The heading reads "Academic Verification."
    *   Below the heading, there's an upward-pointing arrow suggesting a collapsible section.
    *   A text block prompts the user to enter their name, school's country, school's name, and date of birth (as per school records).
    *   It also mentions that the provided email address might be used for verification purposes.

**Key Text:**

*   "Microsoft Azure"
*   "Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method."
*   "Academic Verification"
*   "Start by entering your name as per the school records. Select your school's country and enter your school's name. Enter your date of birth as per the school records. The email address may be used to reach you if we have trouble verifying your application, so please enter your school provided email address."

**Interpretation:**

The image shows a user who is attempting to use a school-provided email address to access a service on Microsoft Azure. However, the email domain has not been registered with Microsoft Azure and the user is being prompted to choose an alternative verification method. In order to verify, the user will also be prompted to enter their name, school's country, school's name, and date of birth (as per school records).

In summary, the image presents the page an educational user lands on when attempting to verify their account to be able to access academic related services provided by Microsoft Azure.

Here is a detailed description of the image content:

The image shows a form section titled "Academic Verification" on a webpage or application. The form is intended to collect user information for verification purposes. 

**Form Header and Instructions:**

*   **Title:** "Academic Verification"
*   **Instructional Text:** A paragraph explains the form's purpose. It directs users to enter their name as it appears in school records, select their school's country, enter the school name, and provide their date of birth, again as per the school records. It also mentions that the email address provided may be used to contact the user for verification purposes if there are issues.

**Form Fields:**

1.  **First name:**
    *   Label: "First name"
    *   Input Field: Prefilled with the name "shashikumar".

2.  **Last name:**
    *   Label: "Last name"
    *   Input Field: Currently empty.
    *   Validation Message: Under the field, a red text "This field is required" indicates that the last name field is mandatory.

3.  **Country:**
    *   Label: "Country"
    *   Dropdown Menu: Set to "India".

4.  **School name:**
    *   Label: "School name"
    *   Input Field: Filled with "Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)".

Hi @lakshaygarg654  
In both the scenarios you laid out, the second implementation is correct. Your response to our API request should be a JSON object `{"answer" : "YOUR RESPONSE AS STRING"}`. In any case the value of the `"answer"` key should be a string.

This is a basic prototype function we would be using to send requests to your URL.

```
def run(question, file_path):
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api"
    questions = {'question': question}
    files = [
        ('file', open("abcd.zip", 'rb')),
        ('file', open("dcba.img", 'rb'))
    ]
    response = requests.post(url, data=questions, files=files)
    return response

```

or

```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "question=question" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip" \
  -F "file=@dcba.img"

```

HI @ripusudan  
This has been a problem with all direct entry students. Unfortunately, there is no way we can help you with this problem. The best way out is asking a friend who is not a TDS student for this term to create a Azure VM for you.

I couldn’t find this function on the Project Doc and I made the project based on the curl function calling.

Saransh\_Saini:

At this moment it can’t be changed as I am occupied with other things. Please keep the question parameter as “question” and file parameter as “file” in the evaluation which is on the Project 2 page and the content type as multipart/form-data.

To clarify if I can handle any one of these 2 methods, I will be fine?

Edit:  
Just now discovered that the field names are indeed “question” and “file” only in both the cases. Sorry for the oversight.

Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a slightly blurry portrait of a young man, likely taken indoors. 

**Subject:**

*   **Young Man:** The central figure is a young man. He has short, dark hair. He has a light complexion and appears to be smiling.

**Clothing:**

*   **Striped Shirt:** He is wearing a short-sleeved shirt with a horizontal stripe pattern. The stripes alternate between dark and light colors, likely blue and white.

**Background:**

*   **Blurred Background:** The background is blurred, but it suggests an indoor setting.
*   **Objects in the Background:** There appear to be furniture, decorative items, and possibly other people or objects that are not clear due to the blur. There is a framed picture in the background.

**Other Relevant Features:**

*   **Lighting:** The lighting appears to be relatively bright.
*   **Composition:** The man is centrally positioned in the frame. The image focuses on him and his upper body.

Let me know if you have any more specific questions about the image!
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

@carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj  
I have a few queries. Even a yes/no response for each would suffice.

GA1:  
Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question *WILL NOT* be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right?

GA2:  
Q2 - Compress an image: Should my app’s response be like this

```
{
     "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image"
}

```

Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too **WILL NOT** be checked against any other email, right?

GA3:

Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here.

GA4:

The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions. When the question will be sent to my app, will the link of the website to be scraped be written as a full link in the question itself or will it be sent in some other way?

GA5:

No particular questions at the moment.

Please help me out by answering these asap

@Saransh\_Saini  
As per your reply time, I was in TDS session at that time.  
And asked same doubt, @Jivraj said 1st implementation they will use.

Session link ( watch at 26:55)

Kindly clarify this.
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows an emoji. Specifically, it's the "Smiling Face with Open Mouth and Cold Sweat" emoji.

*   **Shape and Color:** It's a circular yellow face.
*   **Facial Features:**
    *   It has a wide-open mouth showing teeth and a pink tongue.
    *   The eyes are curved and closed, expressing amusement or mirth.
    *   A single blue droplet (symbolizing sweat) is positioned to the left of the face.
*   **Overall Impression:** The emoji conveys a feeling of relief, awkwardness, or perhaps a near miss situation, often accompanied by nervous laughter.

What Jivraj agreed was stringifying the answer and putting it in as the value of the `"answer"` key in the JSON object.  
`{ "answer" : "YOUR_STRINGIFIED_ANSWER" }`

Just check the Project 2 page on the portal. It’s clearly mentioned a JSON object has to sent not a strigified version of the entire JSON object.  

image1022×277 11.6 KB
The image shows an example of a JSON object that is intended to be submitted as an answer to an assignment. The JSON object has one key-value pair. The key is "answer" and the value is a string: "1234567890". The instructions in the image say that the response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field called "answer."

Response from api should be a string, which if we load using json.loads it should load json object with answer key.

This is correct, make sure you test decoding base64 string before deadline.

Same answer as Q13 GA1

22f3000819:

We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal```  
One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:

```
au7BK3 33 H 5   lKz6y4n  oQmbgoX 0  hNW3JH  68Q1u

```

Write a Python program that uses `httpx` to send a POST request to OpenAI’s API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically:

1. Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.
2. Use `gpt-4o-mini` as the model.
3. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.
4. The second message must be **exactly** the text contained above.

This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.

**Note**: This uses a dummy `httpx` library, not the real one. You can only use:

1. `response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs)`
2. `response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs)`
3. `response.raise_for_status()`
4. `response.json()`

```

As per the portal, we have to return a JSON object as a response from the API. However, if we load a JSON object directly using `json.load()`, it will throw an error. We need to first convert it into a JSON string and then load it using `json.loads( )`. For clarity I add image below.

This question has been stretched for too long—it’s not that big.

I guess @Jivraj is right.

image562×700 23.4 KB
The image shows a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to work with JSON data.

**Part 1: Error Demonstration**

1.  **Import Statement:** `import json` imports the `json` module, which is necessary for working with JSON data in Python.
2.  **Dictionary Definition:** `my_response = { "answer": "26272" }` defines a Python dictionary called `my_response`. This dictionary represents a JSON object.
3.  **Error Code:** `print(json.loads(my_response) ["answer"])` is the problematic line. The intention is to parse the `my_response` dictionary as JSON data and then access the value associated with the key "answer". However, `json.loads()` expects a string (or bytes, bytearray) as input, not a Python dictionary. This causes the `TypeError`.
4.  **Traceback:** The traceback shows the `TypeError` that occurs. The error message "the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not <class 'dict'>" confirms that `json.loads()` received a dictionary as input instead of a string.

**Part 2: Solution**

1.  **Same Dictionary Definition:** The code repeats the `my_response` dictionary definition.
2.  **JSON Conversion:**  `my_response = json.dumps(my_response)`  This line is crucial. `json.dumps()` converts the Python dictionary `my_response` into a JSON *string*.
3.  **Corrected Code:** `print(json.loads(my_response) ["answer"])` Now, the `json.loads()` function receives a JSON string (due to the `json.dumps` conversion in the previous line), which it can successfully parse into a Python dictionary. The `["answer"]` then accesses the corresponding value.
4.  **Output:** The final output is "26272", which is the value associated with the "answer" key in the JSON data.

**In Summary:**

The image illustrates a common error when working with JSON in Python: attempting to parse a Python dictionary with `json.loads()` instead of first converting it to a JSON string using `json.dumps()`. The second part of the image demonstrates the correct approach by using `json.dumps()` to convert the Python dictionary into a JSON string before parsing it with `json.loads()`.

@Jivraj @carlton sir because of this mismatch we have to edit manually after clicking check button again and again

please guide me how to solve this
Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Overall:**

The image presents instructions for a task involving data extraction from IMDb (Internet Movie Database). The task focuses on retrieving movie data and organizing it into a JSON format.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Title:** "Your Task"
*   **Instructions:** The task is described in four numbered steps:
    1.  **Source:** Utilizes IMDb's advanced web search at `https://www.imdb.com/search/title/` to access movie data.
    2.  **Filter:** Filters all titles with a rating between 2 and 8.
    3.  **Format:**
        *   Extracts details (ID, title, year, and rating) for the first 25 titles meeting the criteria.
        *   The movie ID is located in the URL after "tt" in the `href` attribute. Example: `tt10078772`.
        *   Organizes the data into a JSON structure. An example structure is provided:
            ```json
            [
                { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
                { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2"},
                // ... more titles
            ]
            ```
    4.  **Submit:** Asks the user to submit the JSON data in a text box below.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The task requires web scraping or using an API to extract data from IMDb.
*   Specific criteria (rating between 2 and 8, first 25 titles) are provided for filtering.
*   A specific format (JSON) is required for the output data.
*   The location of the movie ID within the URL is clarified.
 The image shows a code snippet, likely in JavaScript, that seems to be designed to fetch and parse data from IMDb (Internet Movie Database). Here's a breakdown:

*   **Initial Logic:** The code begins with `r > n && ([n, r] = [r, n]);`. This line checks if `r` is greater than `n`, and if so, swaps their values. This is likely related to user ratings, possibly ensuring they are ordered correctly for the IMDb query.

*   **Asynchronous Function:** An asynchronous function `g` is defined using `let s, d = async g => { ... }`. This suggests the function will make network requests.

*   **Data Check:** Inside `g`, the code starts with `if (!s) { ... }`. This likely checks if the variable `s` (probably intended to hold some initial data or state) is empty or null.

*   **Fetching Data:** A `fetch` request is made to a URL that seems to be a proxy for the IMDb search page: `fetch('/proxy/https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?user_rating=${r},${n}')`. This URL dynamically builds a search query based on the values of `r` and `n` (user ratings).

*   **Error Handling:** If the `fetch` request is successful (indicated by `if (h.ok)`), the response is converted to text using `s = await h.text();`. If the request fails, an error is thrown: `throw new Error('I wasn't able to get the IMDb data to verify. Please try again. Response: ${h.status} ${h.statusText}')`.

*   **DOM Parsing:** The code then attempts to parse the retrieved data as HTML. It uses `new DOMParser().parseFromString(s, "text/html")` to create a DOM object from the response `s`.
    *   It then queries for specific HTML elements matching the CSS selector `.ipc-metadata-list-summary-iten`.
    *   The results are then mapped using `.map(h => { l = Array(25)`. This suggests they may want to create a new array named l

*   **Data Extraction:** Within the mapping operation, the code extracts the ID, title, year, and rating from the HTML structure by using `querySelector` methods to select elements based on CSS classes, such as ".ipc-title-link-wrapper", ".ipc-title\_\_text", ".dli-title-metadata-item", and ".ipc-rating-star--rating".

*   **Return Value:** Finally, the function returns an object containing the extracted data:

    ```javascript
    return {
    id: m,
    title: b,
    year: S,
    rating: w
    };
    ```

**Summary:**

The code's purpose is to fetch data from IMDb related to titles with specific user ratings, parse the HTML response, and extract relevant information such as ID, title, year, and rating.

@carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj I just wanted to bring to your attention that in GA4 question 2, the answer evaluation script expects the movie title as “17. Kraven: The Hunter” but it is actually listed on the IMDb page as “17. Kraven the Hunter”, resulting in the correct one being marked wrong.  
No questions here just wanted to bring it to attention so that it does not affect the project evaluation script.

Its unusual to have a docker container worth 7 GBs of space. Here is what you can do

* Remove unused libraries from your `requirements.txt`. Sometimes having resource demanding libraries like `SentenceTransformers` can install large sub-dependency packages.
* Exclude your virtual environment folder from the container creation
* Create a `.containerignore` file to have an exception for those folders you want to skip.
* Clear your package cache and any vscode cache you might have.

In the previous replies, you’ve mentioned that for Github questions → actions, pages (GA2) that if the email changes for everyone it means that its parameterised. However, in one of the live sessions this week, Carlton had mentioned that for these questions, it wont be parameterised as this is very individual specific. The same goes for the docker hub question of GA2 as well. KIndly clarify on the same.

For GA2 Q9 → I have given an input file via post request and my fastapi server can handle get requests and its as follows. Kindly confirm if my url is good to go for this specific question.

Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**
The image presents a web interface, likely for testing or documenting an API endpoint.  It shows a "POST" request to an endpoint `/api/uploadCsv`. The interface is divided into sections for parameters, request body, and responses.

**Header:**
*   **"POST /api Upload Csv"**: Indicates this is a `POST` request being made to the `"/api/uploadCsv"` endpoint.
*   A description: *"Accept a CSV file and return student data. Optional class filters via query string: /api?class=1A&class=1B"*

**Parameters:**

A table is displayed for parameters:
*   **Name:** `class`, **Description:** `1A`, with a decrement button and an increment button.
*   **Name:** `arrayString`, **Description:** `[arrayString] Null`, with a decrement button and an increment button. A button to "Add string item" is also included under it.
*   **(query)** indicating the parameters are part of the query.

**Request Body:**
*   **Request body** with *"required"* marking.
*   **multipart/form-data**
*   **file***required** , a button "Choose file " to upload file `opstestapi.csv`, `string(binary)` .

**Execution & Clearing:**
*   An "Execute" button triggers the API call.
*   A progress bar is shown executing an API request.
*   A "Clear" button is available.

**Responses:**
*   A section labeled "Responses" displays the API's responses.
*   **Curl:**  Displays the curl command corresponding to the request:
    ```
    curl -X "POST" \
      "https://bhcc-223-178-84-140.ngrok-free.app/api?class=1A&class=1B" \
      -H "accept: application/json" \
      -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
      -F "file=@opstestapi.csv;type=text/csv"
    ```
*   **Request URL**: Displays the request URL that was called: `https://bhcc-223-178-84-140.ngrok-free.app/api?class=1A&class=1B`

**Server Response:**
*   The "Server response" section shows the result of the API call.
*   **Code:**  `200`, indicating a successful HTTP response.
*   **Response body:**  Displays a JSON response:
```json
{
    "students": [
        {
            "studentId": 213,
            "class": "1A"
        },
        {
            "studentId": 344,
            "class": "1A"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Key observations:**
*   The interface allows users to define request parameters (class, array string) and upload a CSV file.
*   The curl command displays how to make the request from the command line.
*   The server response contains an array of student objects, each with a `studentId` and `class`.

@Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
Sir, in GA4 Question 7, the portal gives the boundary of ultra-new user as the exact time when it was opened, right?  

image1602×275 34.1 KB

  
So, will this boundary for ultra-new user be sent as parameter in the question or can my app use datetime.now() to set the ultra-new user boundary?
Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Content Overview:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a user interface, likely related to a data analysis or recruitment tool focused on GitHub users.  It outlines key capabilities and instructions for a specific task.

**Textual Elements:**

*   **Bullet Points (Capabilities):**
    *   **Competitive Intelligence:**  Focuses on staying updated on emerging trends within local developer communities and talent acquisition strategies.
    *   **Efficiency:** Automation frees up recruiters' time for engagement and relationship-building.
    *   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Leverages standardized and reliable data for recruitment and market research decisions.

*   **Instructions/Task Description:** "Enter the date (ISO 8601, e.g. "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z") when the newest user joined GitHub."  This indicates a task where the user must input a date (in ISO 8601 format) representing the join date of the newest GitHub user being analyzed.

*   **Search Parameters and Filters:** "Search using location: and followers: filters, sort by joined descending, fetch the first url, and enter the created\_at field. Ignore ultra-new users who JUST joined, i.e. after" This section outlines search criteria. The search is based on location and follower count, sorts by join date in descending order, retrieves the first URL (likely a profile URL), and enters the "created\_at" field.  It also filters out recently joined users.

*   **Timestamp:** "3/30/2025, 7:21:18 PM" (likely the date and time of the screenshot or a related event)

**Objects:**

*   **Input Box:**  A greyed out input box is visible, suggesting a field where the user would enter the date.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image showcases a system that allows users to search and filter GitHub user data based on various criteria. The user is prompted to enter a date, and instructions are given for refining the search to exclude recently joined users and to use other search parameters like location and follower count. The system seems to prioritize data-driven decision-making and efficiency in the talent acquisition process.

I am going to clarify this once and for all  
The response should be a **JSON Object** with the value of the `"answer"` key as a string.

```
{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }

```

This is the way we are expecting your responses.  
However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified. We don’t want anyone to loose their marks for such a miniscule error.  
So,

```
"{\"answer\": \"YOUR_ANSWER\"}"

```

is also valid.

@Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @carlton  
Sir, I have an issue in GA5 Q3

What is the number of successful GET requests for pages under **/telugu/** from **11:00** until before **20:00** on Mondays?

For this, I have used two python scripts to get the answer, one written completely by me and another from someone else’s solution; both give the same answer - **2698**

However, the portal says it’s incorrect. No modifications resulting in different answer are being accepted either and the modifications themselves seem to break the bounds of the question.

Please check the scripts and tell me where I am going wrong.

My script:

```
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

def isDay(dtobj, day):
  return dtobj.weekday() == day

def isTime(dtobj, l, u):
  return l <= dtobj.hour < u

step1 = subprocess.run("cat data | grep -i 'GET /telugu/'", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
subprocess.run("rm -f forstep2.txt", shell=True)
with open('forstep2.txt', 'a') as f:
  for line in step1.stdout.splitlines():
    try:
      status = int(line.split()[8])
    except Exception as e:
      status = 400
    if 200 <= status < 300:
      f.write(line + '\n')
step2 = subprocess.run("cat forstep2.txt | cut -d ' ' -f4", capture_output=True, shell=True, text=True)
count = 0
for line in step2.stdout.splitlines():
  log_datetime = datetime.strptime(line.strip('['), "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
  if(isDay(log_datetime, 0) and isTime(log_datetime, 11, 20)):
    count += 1

count

```

I had extracted and uploaded the `data` after extraction using gzip into colab and then executed the script.

The other script:

```
import pandas as pd
import gzip
import re
import os
from datetime import datetime
import hashlib
from google.colab import files

# Function to compute SHA-256 hash
def compute_hash(text):

    log_pattern = (r'^(\S+) (\S+) (\S+) \[(.*?)\] "(\S+) (.*?) (\S+)" (\d+) (\S+) "(.*?)" "(.*?)" (\S+) (\S+)$')
    match = re.match(log_pattern, line)
    if match:
        return {

        print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.")
        return pd.DataFrame()

    parsed_logs = []
    with gzip.open(file_path, 'rt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        for line in f:
            parsed_entry = parse_log_line(line)
            if parsed_entry:
                parsed_logs.append(parsed_entry)
    return pd.DataFrame(parsed_logs)

# Convert time format
def convert_time(timestamp):
    return datetime.strptime(timestamp, "%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z")

df = load_logs(file_path)

if not df.empty:
    df["datetime"] = df["time"].apply(convert_time)
    df["day_of_week"] = df["datetime"].dt.strftime('%A')
    df["hour"] = df["datetime"].dt.hour

    # Filter conditions
    filtered_df = df[
        (df["method"] == "GET") &
        (df["url"].str.startswith("/telugu/")) &
        (df["status"] >= 200) & (df["status"] < 300) &
        (df["day_of_week"] == "Monday") &
        (df["hour"] >= 11) &
        (df["hour"] < 20)
    ]

    # Compute hash of the result
    result_hash = compute_hash(str(len(filtered_df)))

    # Output the count and hash
    print("Successful GET requests for /telugu/ on Mondays (11:00-7:59 AM):", len(filtered_df))
else:
    print("No log data available for processing.")

Both give the same output: 2698. Please help me identify the error, if any.

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout**

The image displays a form for "Academic Verification," likely from a website or application. The form fields are arranged vertically. There's a message at the top indicating an issue with the email domain.

**Textual Information**

*   **Title:** "Academic Verification"
*   **Instructional Text:** "Start by entering your name as per the school records. Select your school's country and enter your school's name. Enter your date of birth as per the school records. The email address may be used to reach you if we have trouble verifying your application, so please enter your school provided email address."
*   **Fields and Labels:**
    *   "First name" (filled with "VIKASH")
    *   "Last name" (filled with "PRASAD")
    *   "Country" (selected "India")
    *   "School name" (filled with "Indian Institute Of Technology Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu)")
*   **Disclaimer:** "If your country is not listed, the offer is not available in your region. Learn More"
*   **Note:** "School name will help provide Microsoft with additional information for verification. If available, please enter it here."
*   **Error message**: "Your email domain is not currently registered with us. You can choose another verification method."

**Visual Elements**

*   **Form Fields:** There are input fields for "First name", "Last name", and "School name". The "Country" field is a dropdown menu with "India" currently selected.
*   **Expand/Collapse Icon:** There's an upward-pointing arrow icon next to the "Academic Verification" title, suggesting that the form section can be collapsed.

**Inferred Information**

*   The form is part of a registration or verification process, possibly for a student or educator.
*   The information entered should match the records at the school.
*   The "Learn More" link likely directs to a page explaining which countries are eligible for the offer.

**Overall, the image is a snapshot of an online form for academic verification, where a user has entered their name, selected their country, and specified their school.**
 Here's a description of the content of the image:

The image shows a form field with the label "School email address" above it. Inside the form field, the following text is displayed: "21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".

Hi,  
i deployed the application the application in render. It is free for 750 hours per month. But it is saying if the application is inactive mode, it will be go spin-off mode and take some 50 seconds to respond to the first query from inactive mode.  
is that ok?

is the port is correct @Jivraj
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a form section related to configuring inbound port rules for a virtual machine. The section is titled "Inbound port rules". A description explains that this allows selecting which virtual machine network ports are accessible from the public internet and that more granular network access can be configured on the Networking tab.

Below the title and description, there is a section labeled "Public inbound ports *". An asterisk indicates that this is a required field. The available options are:
*   "None" - a radio button to select no inbound ports
*   "Allow selected ports" - a radio button, currently selected

Below the "Allow selected ports" option, there is a field labeled "Select inbound ports *" which is also a required field. The selected port is "SSH (22)" shown in a dropdown box.

Finally, there is a warning message in a light-colored box with an orange warning triangle icon. The text of the warning reads: "This will allow all IP addresses to access your virtual machine. This is only recommended for testing. Use the Advanced controls in the Networking tab to create rules to limit inbound traffic to known IP addresses."

@Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @carlton

What is the request timeout for each question, especially for the question on YouTube video transcription? I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.  
For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.

So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.

Question —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?

Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.

Regards,  
Shivaditya

For the FastAPI type questions, my endpoints are like http://ip:port/endpoint. But while testing using the portal it expects HTTPS instead of http. But nothing of that sort is given in the question. Will the evaluator also expect a https url or is a http url enough for it to hit the endpoint?

q-vercel-python.json will be same or different?

image1548×391 39.2 KB

Will the llamafile be same?  

image780×221 21.5 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Theme:** The image shows a tutorial or instructions for deploying a Python application to Vercel and creating an API endpoint.

**Key elements and text:**

1.  **Download Link:**
    *   "Download this q-vercel-python.json which has the marks of 108 imaginary students."
    *   A file named `q-vercel-python.json` is mentioned.

2.  **Deployment Instructions:**
    *   "Create and deploy a Python app to Vercel."
    *   "Expose an API so that when a request like `https://your-app.vercel.app/api?name=X&name=Y` is made, it returns a JSON response with the marks of the names X and Y in the same order, like this:"
    *   This instructs the user to create an API endpoint that accepts two name parameters (X and Y) and returns a JSON response containing their marks.

3.  **Example JSON Response:**
    *   `{"marks": [10, 20])`
    *   Shows the expected format of the JSON response, with a key "marks" containing an array of two numbers (presumably the marks of the two students).

4.  **CORS Instructions:**
    *   "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin."
    *   Highlights the importance of enabling CORS for the API.

5.  **Vercel URL Question:**
    *   "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`"
    *   Asks for the user's Vercel URL.

6.  **User Response:**
    *   `https://vercel-tds-one.vercel.app/api`
    *   Shows an example answer to the question with a specific URL.

**In summary:** The image provides instructions for creating a Python API on Vercel that retrieves and returns the marks of two students, given their names as parameters. It also emphasizes the importance of CORS and asks the user to provide their Vercel app URL.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:** The image shows a screenshot of text, likely from a command-line interface or a tutorial. It outlines instructions for using Llamafile and ngrok.

**Text Content:**

*   **"Download Llamafile. Run the Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6\_K.llamafile model with it."** This indicates the first step involves downloading a file named "Llamafile" and specifies a particular model to use.
*   **"Create a tunnel to the Llamafile server using ngrok."** This instructs the user to set up a tunnel to the Llamafile server using the ngrok service.
*   **"What is the ngrok URL? It might look like: https://\[random].ngrok-free.app/"** This poses a question and provides a potential example of what the ngrok URL might look like. It suggests the URL has a random element within its structure.
*   **"https://aafb-2405-201-4007-c068-eb1d-b640-5d42-2493.ngrok-free.app"** This is a complete example of a ngrok URL, likely outputted by the ngrok service when the tunnel is created.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Llamafile:** A key term referring to some file or application.
*   **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6\_K.llamafile:** A specific model name associated with Llamafile.
*   **ngrok:**  A service used to create tunnels to local servers.
*   **URLs:** The screenshot focuses on the ngrok URL, providing an example and a real instance of it.

In summary, the image presents a tutorial-like snippet concerning Llamafile and ngrok, focusing on finding the ngrok URL after setting up a tunnel.

hello i want to know about this currently I am using approach like you provide HTML page URL and my internal approach and run hidden value or you provide URL website

image788×325 9.21 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image presents a question or prompt in a simple, clean design. It seems to be part of an interactive online form or test.

**Text Elements:**

*   **"Just above this paragraph, there's a hidden input with a secret value."** This is the setup, indicating there's a piece of information to find on the page.
*   **"What is the value in the hidden input?"** This is the question being asked, guiding the user to identify the secret value mentioned earlier.
*   **"Check"** This is the label on a button, presumably used to submit an answer.

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Text Input Field:** A grayed-out input field for the user to type in their answer.
*   **Button:** A blue button labeled "Check," used to submit the answer.

**Inference:**

The task is likely to involve inspecting the source code of the webpage (or using browser developer tools) to locate a hidden input field and its value. The user is then expected to enter that value in the provided text box and click "Check."

image974×281 14.5 KB
Here's a description of the image content, focusing on elements that would help answer questions related to it:

**Overall Content:** The image is part of an interactive coding exercise or a tutorial, focusing on CSS selectors. It presents a problem or a question to the user.

**Key Text Elements:**

*   "Let's make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors." - This sets the context, indicating the problem involves CSS selectors.
*   "Find all `<div>`s having a *foo* class in the hidden element below. What's the sum of their *data-value* attributes?" - This is the core problem statement. The task is to identify `<div>` elements with the class "foo" within a hidden element and then calculate the sum of their "data-value" attributes.
*   "Sum of data-value attributes:" - This label indicates the input field's purpose.
*   "Check" - This is a button, likely used to submit the answer for validation.

**Other Visual Elements:**

*   Input Field: There's an empty input field, where the user is expected to enter the calculated sum.
*   "Check" Button: A button, probably for submitting the answer.

**Inferred Information:**

*   Hidden Element: The question mentions a "hidden element below." This suggests that there's HTML code (not directly visible in the image) containing `<div>` elements with the class "foo" and associated "data-value" attributes.
*   Coding Context: The overall presentation indicates that this is part of a coding exercise or tutorial, where the user is expected to use CSS selectors and potentially some form of scripting (like JavaScript) to extract the "data-value" attributes and calculate their sum.

In essence, the image presents a coding challenge: use CSS selectors to find specific elements, retrieve their attributes, and perform a calculation.

do you know answer of this that time i got answer
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Content:**

The image shows information about a SQLite database table called "tickets". This table stores customer bids for concert tickets. The table has the following columns:

*   **type:** The type of ticket (e.g., bronze, silver).
*   **units:** The number of tickets being bid on.
*   **price:** The price per ticket.

**Table Data:**

A sample of the data is shown in the image:

*   bronze: 297 units, price 0.6
*   Bronze: 673 units, price 1.62
*   Silver: 105 units, price 1.26
*   Silver: 82 units, price 0.79
*   SILVER: 121 units, price 0.84

**Question:**

The question asks for the total sales of all items with the ticket type "Gold". The user is instructed to write the SQL to calculate this.

**Note:** There is no "Gold" ticket type displayed in the shown table data. However, the query should still work assuming the table contains Gold type tickets.

Sir, I have created the frontend app like an html page with the fastapi utilizing the chatgpt-o3 , instead of Api key. I managed to get api keys but ended up in only text mining without file handing (not able to do multipart-form data). So, I have made to use the model and designed a frontend which also takes the input from the file uploaded, So, it will be ideal for assignment solver, Isn’t it , Sir? @carlton @Karthik\_POD
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a simple web application or form, designed as an "AI Assignment Solver".  The interface is clean and utilizes a consistent color scheme of various shades of purple.  It offers two primary methods for obtaining help: uploading a file or asking a question directly.

**Text Elements:**

*   **Title:**  "AI Assignment Solver" in large, bold white text at the top.
*   **Section Headers:** "Upload a File" and "Ask a Question" are used to organize the main input areas.
*   **File Upload:** A "Choose File" button and the text "No file chosen" indicate a file selection option.
*   **Upload Button:** The button labelled "Upload" is used to upload the file once selected.
*   **Upload Status:** The text "No file uploaded" is displayed below the upload button to confirm that no file has been uploaded.
*   **Question Input:** "Enter your question here" is a placeholder text within a text input field.
*   **Submit Button:** A "Submit" button is positioned to send the question.
*   **Answer Area:** "Answer will appear here." is placeholder text within an output area, indicating where the solution will be displayed.

**UI Elements and Layout:**

*   **Background:** The background is a solid gradient of purple.
*   **Container:** The interface elements are placed within a rounded-corner rectangular container, which gives the impression of a clean and modern design.
*   **Input Fields:** There's a file selection element (Choose File) and a text input area for the question.
*   **Buttons:** There are two buttons "Upload" and "Submit".
*   **Output Field:** A larger text area to present the answer.

This is the output Sir @carlton @Karthik\_POD . Also my project-1 has not been scored .. till now .. Please review that also. Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread - #240
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

The image presents a text-based calculation scenario. The text, set against a lavender background with subtle color variations, details a series of monetary values.

**Numerical Data:**
*   A list of negative values (ranging from -2,400.00 to -20,03,030.00) is followed by the prompt "Now, let's calculate the total."
*   Another list of negative values (ranging from -1,233.00 to -20,03,030.00), with an additional entry "-5,000.00 (total of subsequent similar entries)."

**Calculations:**
*   A "Summing these values" section then showcases an addition equation: "1,233.00 + 56,767.00 + 2,400.00 + 1,234.00 + 10,000.00 + 20.00 + 2,000.00 + 2,003,030.00 + 5,000.00 = 2,073,684.00"

**Conclusion:**
*   The final line concludes: "Thus, the total value of complaints is **2,073,684.00**."

In summary, the image is a visual representation of a calculation process involving various monetary values, ultimately determining the total value of complaints.

Hi @22f3000370  
We appreciate the efforts you have put in. But, for the project we aren’t expecting a full-stack app with an integrated frontend. We just need an API endpoint on which we would be able to send requests in the given format. For more info check the TDS course page. Tools in Data Science

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web developer tool or API client, possibly showing the response to an API request. It's divided into sections:

1.  **curl Command:**  Shows the command used to make the API request.
2.  **Request URL:** Displays the URL that was targeted in the request.
3.  **Server Response:** This section presents the server's reply, including:
    *   **Code:** A numeric status code (likely 200 OK, indicating a successful request).
    *   **Details:** The body of the response, which is a JSON object in this case.

**Detailed Content:**

*   **curl Command:**
    *   `curl -X 'POST'`:  Indicates that a POST request was made.
    *   `'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/'`: The target URL (likely a local development server).
    *   `-H 'accept: application/json'`: Specifies that the client accepts JSON responses.
    *   `-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data'`: Indicates that the request data is in multipart format (often used for file uploads).
    *   `-F 'question=ShopSmart is an online retail platform that places a high value on customer feedback. Each month, the company receives hundreds of comments'`: Sends a form field named "question" with a string value about "ShopSmart."

*   **Request URL:**
    *   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`: The exact URL that was targeted.

*   **Server Response - JSON Body:** The "answer" field in the JSON response includes a python function that calculates the cosine similarity between each pair of embeddings and returns the pair of phrases that has the highest similarity. The "answer" field includes example usage and sample embedding values related to product reviews (e.g., "Packaging was excellent", "Shipping costs were too high"). The function seems intended for analyzing customer feedback text.

**Key Observations:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The API endpoint seems to be designed for processing questions or statements and providing relevant answers or analysis.
*   **Local Development:** The URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/` indicates that the API is running on the local machine (localhost) during development.
*   **Customer Feedback Analysis:** The code and example data suggest that the API is being used to analyze customer feedback related to an online retail platform ("ShopSmart") and identify similarities between different statements or aspects of feedback (e.g., shipping costs, packaging).

I have deployed the project on render so the first request in evaluation takes around 50 to 60 second is that okay
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web service management interface, likely from a platform like Render.com. It shows the details and status of a specific web service deployment.

**Text Elements:**

*   **"WEB SERVICE"**:  Indicates the type of application being managed.
*   **"TDS-Project-2"**: The name of the project.
*   **"Python 3"**:  Indicates the programming language used for this project.
*   **"Free"**: Likely indicating the project is running on a free tier of service.
*   **"Upgrade your instance →"**: Suggests the option to move to a paid tier with more resources.
*   **"2313001764/TDS-Project-2"**:  Repository information.
*   **"main"**: Shows the current branch.
*   **"https://tds-project-2-pnim.onrender.com"**:  The URL where the web service is deployed.
*   **"Your free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more."**:  A warning message about free tier limitations.
*   **"March 31, 2025 at 4:38 PM"**: Indicates the date and time of some action, likely the last deployment or update.
*   **"In Progress"**: Status of some operation.
*   **"5989351"**:  Probably a unique identifier for the deployment/commit.
*   **"Final Commit"**: A description of the last commit.
*   **"All logs"**: Indicates the user can view all log types.
*   **"Search"**: Functionality to search through logs.
*   **"Live tail"**: Option to show a live tail of log events.
*   **"GMT+5:30"**: Sets the timezone.
*   **"Connect"**: Dropdown to connect to a source like Github.
*   **"Manual Deploy"**: Dropdown for manual deployment options.
*   **"Upgrade now"**: A call to action to upgrade the service tier.
*   **"Cancel deploy"**: A button to cancel the deployment.

**Objects and Visual Features:**

*   **Color Scheme:** The interface uses a dark color scheme with purple accents for alerts and emphasis.
*   **Buttons:** There are buttons like "Cancel deploy".
*   **Dropdowns:** There are buttons with dropdown elements such as "Connect" and "Manual Deploy".
*   **Icons:** Small icons (e.g., a warning symbol) are used to convey information quickly.

**Interpretation:**

The screenshot shows a web service ("TDS-Project-2") hosted on a platform that offers a free tier. The user is likely viewing the details of a specific deployment. The warning about inactivity and spin-down indicates that the free tier has resource limitations. The "In Progress" status along with the "Cancel deploy" button suggests that a deployment or some other operation is currently underway.

I deployed my API using Railway.app, but Jio ISP is blocking requests to `.up.railway.app`. I tested it with five other ISPs, and the API endpoint works perfectly. Could you please consider that some ISPs may be blocking certain domains?

We’ll try to keep this in consideration while developing the evaluation script. But to be on the safer side keep sending requests to your server on such intervals that it doesn’t go inactive.

@Saransh\_Saini @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj

#### Please extend the deadline for TDS Project 2. The MAD 1 project and two OPPEs have taken up all my time. I have completed my TDS project up to the Week 3 assignment solutions, and only two weeks remain to complete Weeks 4 and 5.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content Overview:**

The image features an animated cartoon character of a young boy in a pleading pose. The background is black. The word "PLEASE!" in a bright pink, slightly bubbly font is located next to the boy.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Boy Character:**
    *   **Appearance:** The boy has short, dark grey hair. His eyes are large, black, and shiny, creating a "puppy dog eyes" effect. He has rosy cheeks, giving him a flushed and vulnerable appearance.
    *   **Clothing:** He's wearing a white shirt with a blue and white jacket. He is kneeling, and his pants are dark gray.
    *   **Pose & Expression:** His hands are clasped together in a prayerful or begging position. His mouth is slightly open, as if he is uttering the word "Please!" or making a pleading sound. He appears desperate or very hopeful.
    *   **Emotional Cue:** The overall impression is one of earnest pleading, perhaps conveying a sense of needing help, forgiveness, or wanting something very badly.

*   **Text:**

    *   The word "PLEASE!" is in a bubbly, pink, and slightly tilted font. The exclamation point emphasizes the urgent and emotional nature of the plea.

*   **Background:**

    *   Solid black background. This makes the character and the text stand out prominently.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is designed to elicit empathy or a willingness to comply with the request implied by the "PLEASE!" and the boy's pleading expression. It would be suitable for a situation where someone wants to make a request in an endearing way.

I completely understand the need to keep evaluations on schedule. In that case, would it be possible to grant just a one-day extension? I’ve completed up to Week 3 and just need a little extra time to wrap up Weeks 4 and 5 properly. A single day would really help me submit a more polished project without causing significant delays

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

The image displays an error message related to a serverless function hosted on Vercel.

**Key elements and text:**

*   **"This Serverless Function has crashed."** - This is the main problem indication.
*   **"Your connection is working correctly."** - This indicates the user's internet connection is not the cause of the error.
*   **"Vercel is working correctly."** - This suggests the Vercel platform itself isn't experiencing a general outage.
*   **"500: INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR"** - This is the HTTP status code, indicating a general server-side error.
*   **"Code: FUNCTION\_INVOCATION\_FAILED"** - This specifies that the error occurred during the invocation of the serverless function.
*   **"ID: `bom1::48ghr-1743430791127-d99a1b77819a`"** - This is a unique identifier for this specific error instance, potentially useful for debugging within the Vercel platform.
*   **"If you are a visitor, contact the website owner or try again later."** - Advice to general users of the website.
*   **"If you are the owner, learn how to fix the error and check the logs."** - Advice to the website owner, encouraging them to debug. There are links to "learn how to fix the error" and "check the logs".

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a Vercel error page informing the user that a serverless function has crashed. It provides basic diagnostic information, including error codes and identifiers, and suggests solutions to either try again later or debug with provided documentation.

Stay tuned @all
Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image features a pirate flag waving against a blue sky with scattered white clouds. The flag is primarily black and displays a white skull and crossbones design. Notably, the skull is wearing a yellow straw hat with a red band. This hat is a signature item of the anime character Monkey D. Luffy from the series "One Piece."

The flag is attached to a wooden mast on the left side of the image. The mast is light brown and has several dark bands around it, suggesting segments joined together. The background consists of a clear, bright blue sky with some fluffy white clouds scattered across it. The overall style is cartoonish, reminiscent of animation.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a person, likely a young man, posing for a picture. The background is somewhat blurry, suggesting he's indoors, possibly in a commercial or public space with decorative elements.

**Main Subject:**

*   **Person:** A young man with short, styled dark hair. He has a mustache and appears to be smiling slightly. He is wearing a striped short-sleeved shirt.
*   **Posture:** He is sitting, with his arms resting on his lap. He appears relaxed and comfortable.

**Background:**

*   The background is blurry, but it appears to be an indoor space with some decorative elements. There are hints of shelves with items on them, and indistinct shapes that could be other objects.
*   There appears to be a vertical framed photo or poster hanging in the background.

**Additional Details:**

*   The image quality is relatively low, with some blurring.

If you have any specific questions about the image, feel free to ask!

I noticed that ngrok disconnects after two hours, so I’m wondering if we can continue using it.

If your team was aware of this, I’d like to understand why it was allowed to deploy on ngrok. I typically use Vercel for deployment, but as you know, Vercel doesn’t support certain features.  
what to do now

yes me too  
*Thank You for some sleepless nights(now I have some dark-circles😑) and this wonderful experience*@s.anand @carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a still frame from the American TV show "The Office". It shows a man in a suit standing in what seems to be an office environment.

**Details:**

*   **Person:** The central figure is a man wearing a dark gray/charcoal suit, a light-colored dress shirt, and a tie with a pattern of gray or black shapes against a lavender background. He appears to be looking directly at the camera with a slightly serious or neutral expression. He's clean-shaven with short dark hair. Based on his appearance, this character is likely David Wallace.
*   **Setting:** The background reveals elements of an office space. There is a door with horizontal blinds and a sign attached to the glass that says "MEETING IN PROGRESS" in capital letters. We can see a portion of what looks like a whiteboard or bulletin board on the wall behind the man. To the left of the man are two black office chairs. The walls appear to be light beige or off-white.
*   **Clothing:** The man is wearing a business suit, indicating a professional setting.
*   **Lighting:** The lighting is fairly bright and even, suggesting standard office lighting.
*   **Mood:** The image conveys a neutral mood.

Ah, the true mark of a dedicated developer—when even your dreams come with syntax errors!  This project was a rollercoaster of caffeine, code, and existential debugging at 3 AM. But hey, we survived, and now even my subconscious is running `python main.py` on repeat. On to the next adventure… after some well-earned sleep (hopefully bug-free)!
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a yellow circular emoji. This emoji is a "rolling on the floor laughing" (ROFL) face. 

**Features:**

*   **Color:** Predominantly yellow with dark brown and pinkish-red details.
*   **Facial Expression:** The emoji has a wide, open mouth in a smile or laugh. The eyes are squinted shut, appearing as two "X" shapes, indicating extreme amusement.
*   **Mouth:** The inside of the mouth is dark brown, with a pinkish-red tongue visible. A row of white teeth is visible.
*   **Background:** The background is black, which helps the yellow emoji stand out.

**Overall Impression:**

The emoji conveys a strong sense of laughter, joy, and amusement. It's a very common way to express that something is hilarious.

Hello Sir,  
I hope you’re doing well. On behalf of all the students in our course, I wanted to request a deadline extension for the project 2. We’re all putting in our best effort, but we need a little more time to complete it properly.

If it’s possible to grant an extension, we would really appreciate it. Please let us know if you can consider this request.

Thank you for your time and understanding!  
Saksham

Please sir !

Here's a description of the image:

The image is a medium shot of a Scottish Fold cat. The cat is standing on its hind legs, with its front paws clasped together and raised towards its mouth, in a gesture that resembles a human being in deep thought. The cat has a cute and curious expression, which is amplified by its large, round eyes. Its fur is predominantly gray and white with a tabby pattern. The background is a plain wooden floor, providing a neutral backdrop that keeps the focus squarely on the cat. The overall impression is one of charm and playfulness.

Respected Sir,

I kindly request a deadline extension of at least 3 minutes for the project submission, similar to what was done for ROE. Due to slow internet connectivity and the absence of WiFi, my submission took longer than usual. As a result, I was only able to upload it at 12:01 AM instead of the regular 11:59 PM deadline.  
PLEASE Sir, As I’m a standalone student and this is my primary degree after 12th, please do accept it.

Thank you

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Subject:** The image depicts Tom, the cat from the "Tom and Jerry" cartoon series.

**Appearance:** Tom is drawn in a classic cartoon style. He's a gray cat with a lighter gray stomach and white paws and feet. His eyes are closed, and his face is scrunched up.

**Pose:** Tom is kneeling, with his hands clasped together in front of him in what appears to be a praying or pleading position. His body is hunched over.

**Background:** The background is a blurred, outdoor scene. It appears to be a grassy field with a few trees or bushes in the distance. The colors are muted and soft.

**Overall Impression:** The image conveys a sense of desperation or earnestness. Tom's expression and posture suggest he is pleading or begging for something. The blurring of the background keeps the focus entirely on Tom.

My project is hosted on render, because vercel refuses to cooperate with me, as a result the free version of render takes a minute to respond, and not only that but might also give internal server error until the 2nd or 3rd try. There is nothing I can do to change this except for maybe sending requests every now and then like it was suggested for another student using render. I just want to know if this is okay for evaluation.

I reuesting to all my teachers @s.anand, @carlton, @Jivraj, @Saransh\_Saini please reply me.

What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.

Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. ". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read.

It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.

Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.

hi,

I dont share your views.

i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma.

I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation.

all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them.

I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other.

but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things.

Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc… At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify

for GA’s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections

All in all I am happy with the course.

Dear Shahzada,

You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)

The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.

23f2002668:

> What is this going on? Is it joking?

I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.

23f2002668:

> Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?

We have made **several hours of videos** on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.

23f2002668:

> I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.

Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)

23f2002668:

> They explained what should be your approach? How to make project?

Yes these were explained if you

1. either took part in any live session or
2. watched the recorded video

23f2002668:

> And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?

I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.

23f2002668:

> It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.

Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:  
Create a server api that receives a request.  
The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.  
The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.

Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.

23f2002668:

> Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?

Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.

If you want solutions, there are several options:

1. Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)
2. Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)
3. Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)
4. Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)

23f2002668:

> They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.

This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.

The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.

23f2002668:

> Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.

If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.

But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.

What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.

I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.

23f2002668:

> They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.

Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. **Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.** Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.

Now is a good time to start.

23f2002668:

> Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- "We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. "

That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.

23f2002668:

> I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?

They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.

**Luckily for you,** our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).

23f2002668:

> The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.

If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.

23f2002668:

> In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.

Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?

Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.

But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.

You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.

23f2002668:

> It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.
>
> Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.

I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither `respect` nor `kindness` is evident in your post.

But thank you for your feedback.

One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.

And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

Hi, I have a few things to say

My background :
---------------

I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.

My Initial Disappointments with this Course
-------------------------------------------

In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):

> The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.

* Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph
* ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.
* There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.

Why did I fail?
---------------

### Last Term

I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.

This term.
----------

I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects.

In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.

Me Understanding about the Course Now
-------------------------------------

This one line changed my view about ROE.

On another topic

> **What does this RoE evaluate?** Implicit learning.

I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.

I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.

Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.

In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing `SKLearn`. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.

This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an ***implicit*** way.

This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.

I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks

I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.

I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.

From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.

Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.

Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh\_Saini

> Just two suggestions

* I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.
* While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a close-up portrait of a man. The color palette is warm, with dominant tones of brown and beige. The overall quality seems slightly aged or perhaps shot with a lower-resolution camera, as the details are not extremely sharp.

**Subject:**

*   **Gender:** Male
*   **Age:** Appears to be middle-aged.
*   **Hair:** Dark, thinning hair, neatly combed back.
*   **Face:** A somewhat serious or contemplative expression. Strong cheekbones are visible. He is wearing glasses with thin, dark frames.
*   **Eyes:** Dark, looking slightly upwards to the left.
*   **Attire:** Wearing a light-colored shirt or jacket.

**Background:**

*   The background is a solid, muted brown color, which gives the impression of a studio setting.

**Details that could answer potential questions:**

*   **Glasses:** Indicate possible vision correction.
*   **Facial expression:** Could indicate mood or personality.
*   **Attire:** The style of clothing might give clues to his profession or era the photo was taken.
*   **Background color:** Helps set the tone of the image.

Hello Carlton,

When are you guys likely to test the API endpoints for Project 2?  
I have hosted it on Microsoft Azure, and I only have $92 left out of the free $100 credit. It would be great if you could do this within a week. It is decreasing rapidly.

@parthivn28 @Harshjayswal-2003 @23f2004912  
Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow.

Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets “warmed up” because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up.  
Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation.

Kind regards

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini @s.anand sir, I have noticed that sometimes our vm based application gets stuck and on verifying every request using FastApi have noticed that best way to check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query and it works perfectly fine, not sure have other faced this issue or not, but it would be great if you could take note of this while evaluating just for safety.

Hope you take note of this and take this into consideration.

> check is run and get your answer post that RESET it back and then run another query

I couldn’t get what this part means?
Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

*   **Dominant Feature:** The central element is the uppercase letter "D."
*   **Color and Background:** The "D" is white or light-colored against a solid, deep pink (or magenta) background.
*   **Style:** The "D" appears to have a slight blur or gradient effect, which might suggest it's rendered with a soft, rounded font.

Okay so basically sometimes what happens is while verifying on FASTApi – it gives errors like missing paramaters like… So basically sometimes it needs resetting the request parser and then it works perfectly fine.

```
{
  "detail": "execute() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_bytes'"
}

```

Which is incorrect, so if we press the RESET button and execute it works properly.

Correct output image –  

image1806×235 10.1 KB

Hope you get my point which i’m trying to convey sir.
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout and Context**

The image is a screenshot of a web-based interface for making API requests. It appears to be a form-based tool, likely designed for testing and interacting with an API. The interface is divided into sections for parameters, request body, responses, and curl.

**Sections and Their Contents**

1.  **Parameters Section:**
    *   A header that reads "Parameters"
    *   A message: "No parameters"

2.  **Request Body Section:**
    *   A "Request body" label with an asterisk suggesting it is a required section.
    *   A dropdown menu to the right, displaying "multipart/form-data" indicating the content type for the request body.
    *   A "question" field that is marked required:
        *   Label: "question" (marked with an asterisk to indicate that the field is required)
        *   Type: "string"
        *   Value: "Download and use multi-cursors and convert it into a single"
    *   A "file" field:
        *   Label: "file"
        *   Type constraints (string | null)($binary)
        *   An upload control "Choose File" has the file "q-multi-cursor.json.txt" selected.
        *   A checkbox labeled "Send empty value".

3.  **Buttons:**
    *   "Execute" button (blue) to initiate the request.
    *   "Clear" button (gray) to clear the form fields.
    *   "Cancel" button (red) to cancel the form.
    *   "Reset" button (gray) to reset the form values.

4.  **Responses and Curl Sections:**
    *   "Responses" section header
    *   "Curl" section header

**Text and Labels**

The text is clear and mostly descriptive. The labels indicate the purpose of each field and control. The file type descriptions (string, null, binary) provide information about the expected data types.

**General Observations**

*   The interface is clean and well-organized.
*   Required fields are clearly marked.
*   The use of different content types (multipart/form-data) allows for a variety of data to be sent in the request.
*   The presence of "Responses" and "Curl" sections implies that the results of the request and a corresponding curl command will be displayed after execution.

In summary, the image showcases a user interface for constructing and executing API requests using a web form. It includes sections for setting parameters, defining the request body, and viewing the server's response and the equivalent curl command.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a snippet of a "Server response" section, likely from a web development or API documentation interface. It displays information related to a server's response to a request.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Server Response Header:** The title "Server response" is at the top.
*   **Code and Details:** There are two columns labeled "Code" and "Details."
*   **Response Code:**  A response code of "200" is visible, indicating a successful HTTP request.
*   **Response Body:** Below the code, the text "Response body" introduces a JSON formatted response.
*   **JSON Data:** A JSON object is present within curly braces:
    *   The JSON contains the key "answer" with a string value: "7a5955793fe63e199ad0677dd33f0053c50110a66658925328861ba96c598df24d"
*   **Download Button:** A "Download" button appears to the right of the JSON data, implying the response body can be downloaded as a file.

**Interpretation:**

The image displays a successful (200) HTTP response. The "answer" field contains what looks like a long alphanumeric string, potentially a unique identifier, hash, or encrypted value returned by the server. The download button indicates that the user can download the full response body for further analysis or use.

Just a brother trying to help students gain valuable skills.  
Nothing more brother.

The success of students’ future, is the best reward.

Sometimes it takes a bit longer because some lessons are harder than others. And we all make mistakes. But if you’ve learnt something valuable on the journey, then you are better prepared for what comes next regardless of whether you could clear the obstacle the first time or not.

The way we test your api is **not through a front end.**

We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions.

We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like.

As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine.

Kind regards

sir @carlton currently iam facing an issue sir. just now in order check weather my api is working fine or not . i just tried curl some question but unexpectedly i got timeout error from vercel. i have deployed my app in vercel only. when i checked out i found that in vercel for free account the request timeout is 10s. what to do sir some times gpt take more time to respond. The same endpoint after an hour i tried works fine . will this be an issue sir .

Dear @Carlton and @S.Anand,  
I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel’s free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.  
Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.

We are in the processing pipeline. You will have to wait till it completes. Basically if your endpoint works when we send it a request you will be evaluated. We will use the timestamp of your latest endpoint before the deadline.

Hope that answers your question.

The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.

in spreadsheet edit response modify previous response with timestamp, how you can access that timestamp response?? So how can u have my end point before deadline one since i updated it after deadline.  
Also the before deadline one end point is  
/api which i changed to /api/ after deadline so if u somehow have access to my old url pls consider adding 1 (slash) / :')

I understand your point but what I am saying is that when I edited my end point after deadline it changed my timestamp to after deadline one so that is my concern that my submission might not be even considered

you can have multiple submissions with multiple timestamps in gform. (unless you chose to edit your response, in that situation i have not tested what actually happens).

From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras
================================================================================================

**Project Demo Website**: https://app.algsoch.tech

During our college course *Tool for Data Science (TDS)* at **IIT Madras**, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: **to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API**.

The Mission:
------------

Create a tool that behaves like a **chatbot**, accepts **user queries (text or file-based)** via **web or API**, processes them intelligently, **executes the appropriate code**, and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant.

---

The Journey: From Fails to Final
--------------------------------

At first, the natural choice was to try **LLM agents**—they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries.

Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a **static JSON structure**? That quickly broke when users passed **different parameters, different files**, or queried in **non-standard formats** like “code -s” or “code -v”.

The next idea: write **individual Python scripts per question** from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable.

---

The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping
------------------------------------------

After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:

Centralized engine in `vicky_server.py`  
 Uses **regex-based pattern matching** to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution  
 Each solution is a structured Python function like `ga1_first_solution(query=None)`  
 Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more  
 Acts like a **mini compiler for data science tools**

---

Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS
-------------------------------------------

Vicky is a **smart, modular chatbot** built specifically for **Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras**. It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates.

### Key Features:

**Graded Assignment Solver**  
Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:

* `code -s` / `code -v` → VS terminal commands
* Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching
* GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup
* Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression

**File Upload with Query Matching**  
Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.

**HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder**

* View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy
* Upload Base64 string → Get original image back

**Webhooks Integration**

* Live notifications via **Discord** & **Slack** whenever `/api` endpoints are accessed
* Monitors **server status (online/offline)** and sends real-time updates

**LLM Download + Auto Tunneling**

* Downloads LLaMA models
* Dynamically finds available ports
* Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints

**Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech**

* Ask any TDS question
* Upload and query with files
* Image decoder
* Graded assignment slider navigation
* HTML viewer
* API health status

---

Built With:
-----------

* **FastAPI** for blazing fast APIs
* **Regex & Pattern Matching** for dynamic input detection
* **GitHub Copilot** + my Python debugging and architectural thinking
* Full webhook and status monitoring system
* Modular backend (`vicky_server.py`) and web frontend (`vicky_app.py`)

I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead.  
Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project

Dear Sir,  
I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.  
I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.  
Thank you for your understanding

Hi @carlton

The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to @Saransh\_Saini.

It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.  
We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.

We hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.

Thank you  
Lakshay

Dear Sir @carlton,

Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven’t resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a “/” at the end and that’s it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven’t resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline.

So now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case?  
Sir, please throw some light on my doubt.

Warm Regards,  
Tensed TDS Student

something’s cooking…  And it doesn’t seem like good news for us — at least from the initial visuals.
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on the text and relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a terminal screen displaying log messages. The log appears to be related to a web server, showing HTTP requests and responses. The background is black with green text.

**Key Textual Elements (Log Entries):**

Each line of the log generally follows this pattern:

*   **Date and Time:**  "Apr 05 HH:MM:SS" (e.g., "Apr 05 14:19:25")
*   **Source Information:** "TDS python\[79249]:" This indicates the log message originated from a component named "TDS" written in Python, with process ID 79249. The log level (INFO or WARNING) follow the source information.
*   **Request Information:** An IP address:port combination (e.g., "162.243.238.100:0")
*   **HTTP Request:** A string representing the HTTP request made to the server. Contains the method ("GET", "PROPFIND", "POST"), the requested path, and the HTTP version (e.g., "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.0")
*   **HTTP Status Code and Message:** At the end of each log entry. This part indicates the server's response to the request. For example:
    *   "200 OK" means the request was successful.
    *   "404 Not Found" means the requested resource wasn't found.
    *   "405 Method Not Allowed" means the method used in the request isn't allowed for the requested path.

**Notable Patterns in the Log Messages:**

*   **Frequent 404 Errors:** Several lines indicate "404 Not Found" errors, which suggests clients are requesting resources that don't exist on the server. This might be an indication of probing or malicious activity. A common one is /.env or /.git/config
*   **PROPFIND Requests:** Some lines include "PROPFIND" requests, which are often associated with WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning).  The responses for these are "405 Method Not Allowed", suggesting WebDAV isn't properly configured or supported.
*   **".env" and ".git/config" Requests:** Multiple entries indicate requests for "/.env" and "/.git/config". These files often contain sensitive information (environment variables, Git configuration).  These requests are most likely from malicious actors attempting to retrieve credentials or configuration information.
*   **One WARNING message** of "Invalid HTTP request received".

**Terminal Prompt:**

At the bottom of the image, the terminal prompt is visible:  `azureuser@TDS:~$`
This tells us:

*   The username is "azureuser".
*   The hostname (or system name) is "TDS".
*   The current directory is the user's home directory (~).
*   The "$" symbol indicates a normal user prompt.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image likely captures a segment of a web server's access log. The log indicates a number of requests, including successful requests (200 OK) as well as errors (404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed). Some of the requests, particularly those targeting `.env` and `.git/config`, might be indicative of reconnaissance attempts by malicious actors.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a yellow emoji face. 

**Features:**

*   **Color:** Predominantly yellow.
*   **Expression:** The emoji has a wide, open-mouthed smile, and its eyes appear closed or squinting. There's a noticeable drop of blue sweat or water bead near its right temple (from our perspective).
*   **Mouth:** The mouth is open, revealing a pink tongue.
*   **Overall Impression:** The emoji conveys a sense of nervous laughter, relief, or possibly "close call" tension. It suggests a situation that was potentially stressful or embarrassing, but now the person or character is laughing it off.

@carlton I’m noticing frequent requests from globally scattered IPs—mostly from cloud or bulletproof hosts like DigitalOcean, Contabo, and Azure—targeting sensitive paths like `/t4`, `/logincheck`, `/.env`, and `/.git/config`. These include IPs from places like New York (162.243.238.100), London (34.89.64.89), Amsterdam (45.148.10.172), Moscow (84.201.151.18), Jaipur (103.175.163.104), and Vilnius (85.255.108.243). It really seems like automated vulnerability scanning or botnet activity. Carlton, what can I do??

Also a better evaluation strat would be to submit the GitHub repo in the form(Else they can make changes to the repo, who checks the commit history?) and maybe conduct a 2 min demo where the student clones the repo and then you run the script?  
I know many students are there but other subjects do it for project courses?

Maybe a helpful tip for next time

If i do fail and repeat this course. Hopefully not XD

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini I too faced the same issue, I received a bunch of hits from random ip addresses and it got shut down.

Screenshot 2025-04-06 at 12.37.36 PM1340×1132 196 KB

I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn’t been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don’t know what actually happened. Please do consider.

Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.
Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the text and potential implications:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a log output, likely from a web server or application. It appears to be logging requests and errors. There's a pattern of numerous "404 Not Found" errors, suggesting that many requested resources are not available on the server.

**Key Textual Information:**

*   **"WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received."**: This indicates that the server received HTTP requests that were malformed or didn't adhere to the expected protocol.

*   **"INFO:"**: Lines starting with "INFO:" are informational log messages.

*   **IP Addresses and Ports (e.g., "104.234.115.27:34430")**: These show the source IP address and port from which the requests originated.  They indicate who is making the requests.

*   **HTTP GET/POST Requests (e.g., "GET / HTTP/1.1", "POST /goform/set\_LimitClient\_cfg HTTP/1.1")**: These represent the HTTP requests that were made to the server. The URL portion (e.g., "/") indicates the resource being requested. The HTTP method ("GET" or "POST") specifies the type of request.

*   **Requested URLs (e.g., "/manage/account/login", "/admin/index.html", "/login.htm", "/hudson")**: These are the specific web pages or resources that were requested.  The variety of URLs suggests the server might be vulnerable or is being probed for common administrative and login interfaces.

*   **"404 Not Found"**: This is the HTTP status code indicating that the requested resource could not be found on the server.

*   **"Shutting down", "Waiting for application shutdown", "Application shutdown complete", "Finished server process \[1320]"**: Indicates the application or server is in the process of shutting down normally.

**Analysis and Implications:**

*   **Security Concerns:** The numerous "404 Not Found" errors, particularly those targeting common administrative URLs ("/admin", "/login", "/remote/login"), suggest that the server might be under attack or being scanned for vulnerabilities.  Attackers often try common paths in an attempt to find accessible administration panels or known vulnerabilities.

*   **Invalid Requests:** The "Invalid HTTP request received" messages are concerning. They could indicate malicious intent (attackers sending malformed requests to try to exploit vulnerabilities) or errors in the client software making the requests.

*   **Resource Availability:** The 404 errors might also mean that the resources were once available but have been removed or moved. This could be due to website changes or maintenance.

*   **Application State:** The "Shutting down" messages indicate that the application is being intentionally shut down, which is likely unrelated to the other errors.

**In summary, the image depicts a server log showing a large number of 404 errors and invalid HTTP requests. This likely signifies some form of malicious activity or a misconfigured/outdated server setup. The application is also shutting down.**

Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Content:**

The image features a yellow-toned emoji depicting a face in a state of deep thought or contemplation.

**Features:**

*   **Expression:** The face has a furrowed brow, slightly narrowed eyes, and a hand positioned on the chin, which are all common indicators of a thoughtful or pondering expression.
*   **Eyes:** The eyes are round and dark.
*   **Mouth:** The mouth is represented by a short, curved line, which gives off a slightly concerned expression.
*   **Hand:** The hand is resting on the chin, with the index finger extended along the cheek or jawline, reinforcing the gesture of deep thought.

**Overall Impression:**

The emoji is a visual representation of thinking, pondering, or being in a state of consideration. It can be used to express confusion, doubt, or contemplation.

@Carlton, I believe you all have evaluated it. For me, there are some requests from a known IP with the following location details:

```
{'status': 'success', 'country': 'India', 'countryCode': 'IN', 'region': 'TN', 'regionName': 'Tamil Nadu', 'city': 'Chennai', 'zip': '600042', 'lat': 13.0895, 'lon': 80.2739, 'timezone': 'Asia/Kolkata', 'isp': 'IIT Madras', 'org': 'IITM', 'as': 'AS141340 IIT Madras', 'query': '103.158.43.17'}

```

This request was made at 4:38:19 IST.  

Screenshot 2025-04-06 1703051231×173 5.14 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Appearance:**

The image is a screenshot of a command-line interface (CLI), likely a terminal or console window. The background is black, and the text is primarily in shades of green and red.

**Text Content and Structure:**

The image primarily contains log entries. Let's break down the key elements:

*   **Timestamps:**  Each log line begins with a timestamp indicating the date and time. Examples include "Apr 06 10:10:28" and "Apr 06 11:08:19".
*   **Source Information:** After the timestamp, there's information about the source of the log message. The entries consistently include "TDS python[79249]".  This suggests that the messages are being generated by a Python script (with a process ID of 79249) running within a "TDS" environment.
*   **Log Level:** The log level is consistently "INFO:", indicating these are informational messages and not warnings or errors.
*   **IP Addresses:** Each log entry features a red colored IP address: 103.158.43.17:0, which implies that the log records network communications to/from this address.
*   **HTTP Requests:**  Following the IP address, there are details about HTTP requests being made:
    *   The first entry shows a "GET" request for "/favicon.ico" (likely requesting a website's favicon).
    *   The other entries are "POST" requests to "/api HTTP/1.0". This suggests interaction with an API endpoint.
*   **HTTP Status Codes:**  All log entries end with "200 OK", meaning that the requests were successful.

**Command Prompt:**

At the bottom of the image, there's a command prompt: "azureuser@TDS:~$". This shows the username ("azureuser"), the host/environment ("TDS"), and the current directory ("~", typically the user's home directory). The "$" indicates that it's a standard user prompt (as opposed to a root or administrator prompt, which might use "#").

**Summary:**

The image shows a snapshot of log entries from a Python application. It reveals network activity, specifically HTTP requests being made to an API endpoint, along with the date, time, and success status. The prompt indicates the user is "azureuser" working within the "TDS" environment.

image1914×292 40.3 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on text and relevant features:

**Overall Layout:**

The image showcases the Postman application, a tool used for testing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It displays a POST request being configured and the response received.

**Top Section:**

*   **Request URL:**  `4.213.61.248:8080/api` is the URL the request is being sent to. The HTTP method is POST.
*   **Tabs:** Tabs allow you to customize different parts of your API request: "Params", "Authorization", "Headers (9)", "Body", "Scripts", and "Settings". "Body" is the currently selected tab.
*   **Environment Selection:**  The dropdown menu shows "No environment" is selected. Environment variables can be useful for managing configurations.
*   **Action Buttons:** "Save", "Share", and a "Send" button, the latter most likely used to execute the API request.

**Body Section:**

*   **Body Type:** "form-data" is selected. A key-value pair is shown:
    *   **Key:** `question`
    *   **Value:** `what is output of -s?`

**Response Section:**

*   **Tabs:** "Body", "Cookies", "Headers (4)", and "Test Results". "Body" is selected.
*   **Response Status:** "200 OK" indicates a successful HTTP request.
*   **Response Time:**  "5.00 s" is the time the request took to complete.
*   **Response Size:** "2.08 KB" is the data size of the response.
*   **Response Content:** The response is structured as JSON.
    *   **Key:** `answer`
    *   **Value:** A long string containing information about the system.
    *   **Specific information contained in the string includes:**
        *   Version: Code 1.96.2
        *   OS Version: Darwin arm64 24.2.0
        *   Hardware: Apple M1 (8 x 2400)
        *   Memory (System): 8.00GB (0.09GB free)
        *   GPU: 6%
        *   And many more parameters about the canvas settings, rendering configuration.

**In Summary:**

The image depicts a scenario where a question ("what is output of -s?") is sent to a server via a POST request, and the server responds with a lengthy string containing detailed system information. The Postman application is used to orchestrate this API interaction.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Overall Impression**
The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or console window, likely showing the output of a program or script related to a language model or AI application. There's JSON data, log information, and a terminal prompt.

**Textual Content**

1.  **Initial Line:**
    *   "LOADED embeddings from cache" (Indicates the program is using pre-calculated word or data representations)
    *   "1 0.37612552369709695" (Likely a numeric identifier and a score or value associated with the embeddings)

2.  **JSON Data:**
    *   The bulk of the image contains what seems to be a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) payload. This data represents information about a language model interaction. Key components include:
        *   `type`: 'function' (Indicates a function call within the model)
        *   `function`: {"name": "solver\_1", "description": "Gives output of a specific command in VS code", ...} (Details a function named "solver_1" designed to generate output based on commands for VS Code.)
        *   `parameters`: (Defines the input parameters for the `solver_1` function, which includes a 'command' string.)
        *   `id`: "chatcmpl-..." (A unique identifier for the chat completion interaction.)
        *   `object`: 'chat.completion' (Specifies that it is a chat completion object.)
        *   `created`: 1743945291 (A timestamp of when the interaction occurred.)
        *   `model`: 'gpt-40-mini-2024-07-18' (Specifies the model being used: "gpt-40-mini" from July 18, 2024.)
        *   `choices`: (An array containing the model's response.)
        *   `message`: (Contains the response from the model.)
            *   `role`: 'assistant'
            *   `content`: None (The main content is absent, which is not unusual when using functions or tools.)
            *   `tool_calls`: (Details about the tools used during the interaction.)
                *   `id`: "call\_INDl0amENHPbPbhTmsTqBIf3"
                *   `type`: 'function'
                *   `function`: {'name': 'solver_1', 'arguments': '{"command":"-s"}'} (The function called was "solver_1", with the command "-s" as input.)
        *   `usage`: (Information about token usage.)
            *   `prompt_tokens`: 63
            *   `completion_tokens`: 18
            *   `total_tokens`: 81
        *   `monthlyCost`: 0.007031520000000004
        *   `cost`: 0.000297
        *   `monthlyRequests`: 34
        *   `costError`: "crypto.createHash is not a function" (Indicates an error related to cryptographic hashing during the process.)
        *   `command`: "-s" (The actual command that was executed)

3.  **Log Information:**
    *   "INFO: 54.86.50.139:41710 - 'POST /api HTTP/1.1' 200 OK" (Log entry showing a successful HTTP POST request to the `/api` endpoint. The IP address "54.86.50.139" and port "41710" are shown.)

4.  **Terminal Prompt:**
    *   `23f2000599@ds.study.iitm.ac.in@TDS-PROJECT:~/tds-solvers$` (Indicates the current user ("23f2000599@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"), hostname ("TDS-PROJECT"), and current directory ("~/tds-solvers") in the terminal.)

**Interpretation**

The image shows a debugging or logging output from a system interacting with a language model. The model is being used to execute commands within VS Code via a function called "solver\_1". The interaction is tracked with detailed usage statistics, and there appears to have been a successful API call related to this process. An error is flagged, indicating a potential problem with a cryptographic function.

@Saransh\_Saini - This is 24f1001631  
The same thing has happened to me as the mentioned above. I also have not received request from Indian IP as far as I can see on the logs. I am using the azure VM itself.  
I rechecked and maybe the server went offline, so I re-ran the script anyway and checked a few questions now and it works.  
I think after a certain while it timed out for me(not entirely sure tho)… but i fixed it.

Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on the text, objects, and features visible:

**Overall Layout**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a tool, likely a REST API client, such as Postman or Insomnia. The interface has a dark theme. It's used for sending API requests and viewing the responses. The title suggests it's part of a testing project named "TDS-Project2-Testing-Again" and specifically relates to a task named "q1-working-now".

**Top Section - Request Configuration**

*   **HTTP Method:** Set to "POST" (indicated by the "POST" button on the left).
*   **URL:** "104.211.116.95:8080/api" indicating the API endpoint being targeted.
*   **Tabs:** A set of tabs to configure the request: "Params", "Authorization", "Headers (9)", "Body", "Scripts", and "Settings". The "Body" tab is currently selected (indicated by the highlighted dot).
*   **Data Format:** Within the "Body" tab, "form-data" is selected, and options like "x-www-form-urlencoded", "raw", "binary", and "GraphQL" are also present.
*   **Key-Value Pairs:** A table for defining the request body parameters:
    *   **Key:** "question"
    *   **Value:** "Install and run Visual Studio Code. In your Terminal (or....." (truncated)
    *   **Type:** Text is specified
    *   Another field is available to upload "file"

**Bottom Section - Response View**

*   **Tabs:** "Body", "Cookies", "Headers (4)", and "Test Results" indicating how the API response can be viewed.
*   **Format:** "JSON" is selected for viewing the response body. There are also options for "Preview" and "Visualize".
*   **Response Body:** A JSON object is displayed. It contains a single key: "answer".
    *   The value of "answer" is a long string containing various system information.  This appears to be the response received from the API request.

**Key Information Extracted from "answer"**

The extracted text from the "answer" value includes:

*   **Version:** Code 1.96.2 (with a long hash value). Also showing "OS Version"
*   **Darwin arm64 24.2.0 CPUs:** Apple M1 (8 x 2400)
*   **Memory:** 8.00GB (0.09GB free)
*   Various graphics and rendering settings status (enabled/disabled) related to GPU compositing, rasterization, WebGL, video encoding, and decoding.
*   Performance information: CPU usage, memory usage, process IDs.

**Other Visual Elements**

*   "Save" and "Share" button at the top.
*   "Send" button to initiate the API request.
*   "Cookies" button next to the "Send" button.
*   A status message "200 OK" in green, indicating the request was successful.
*   Response time "3.86 s" and size "2.08 KB".

**In summary:** The image showcases the configuration of an API request aimed at obtaining system information.  The request includes a question asking the target to install/run Visual Studio Code in the terminal, and the API response contains extensive details regarding the system's OS version, hardware, rendering configurations, and performance metrics.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a Postman API client window.

**Top Section:**

*   **Title/Path:** "TDS-Project2-Testing-Again / ga5 / q5-working" - This likely indicates the name of the Postman collection and folder structure.
*   **HTTP Method:** "POST" - This signifies that a POST request is being configured.
*   **URL:** "104.211.116.95:8080/api" - This is the API endpoint that the request will be sent to.
*   **Buttons:** "Save", "Share", "Send", "Cookies"- These are actions related to saving and sending the request.

**Middle Section (Request Body):**

*   **Tabs:** "Params," "Authorization," "Headers (9)," "Body," "Scripts," "Settings" - These are tabs for configuring different aspects of the API request. The "Body" tab is currently selected.
*   **Body Type Radio Buttons:** "none", "form-data", "x-www-form-urlencoded", "raw", "binary", "GraphQL" - Indicates the chosen body type is "form-data"
*   **Key-Value Pairs:**
    *   **Key:** "question"  **Value:** "Sales Analytics at GlobalRetail Insights" (Text)
    *   **Key:** "file" **Value:** "q-clean-up-sales-data (7).json" (File) and there is a small blue upload icon, which indicates uploading the file to the body

**Bottom Section (Response):**

*   **Tabs:** "Body," "Cookies," "Headers (4)," "Test Results"
*   **Response Status:** "200 OK" - This indicates a successful HTTP response.
*   **Response Time:** "3.68 s"
*   **Response Size:** "143 B"
*   **Response Body:** Displayed in JSON format:
    ```json
    {
        "answer": "10687"
    }
    ```

**Key Observations:**

*   The screenshot shows an API request being constructed using Postman.
*   The request body is of type "form-data" and includes a text field named "question" and file field named "file".
*   The API request appears to be working, as indicated by the "200 OK" status code.
*   The API returns a JSON response that contains the "answer": "10687".

Create a shell script that loops through the list of API endpoints and uses `curl` to send requests to each. You can pass headers, authentication tokens, or data as needed.

@Saransh\_Saini  
Hi sir, just wanted to know when will the results be released. And also in the image I attached it I think shows five different scores for each questions you asked through curl. Is that the mark for each questions and total mark should be considered?

also want to know if we need to do any extra projects for the bonus marks.

thank you

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Context:**

The image is a close-up shot of a laptop screen. The screen displays a terminal window, likely from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The terminal shows output logs related to data science tool executions. There are also time and date settings in the corner of the screen, indicating a date in the future.

**Terminal Window Content:**

*   **Header:** The terminal header includes tabs: "DEBUG CONSOLE", "TERMINAL", "PORTS", "QUERY RESULTS (PREVIEW)", and "COMMENTS". The currently selected tab appears to be "TERMINAL".
*   **Output Logs:** The main portion of the terminal window shows a sequence of log entries. Each entry seems related to running different data science scripts or tools, possibly for question answering or analysis. The logs contain:
    *   File paths to Python scripts (e.g., `E://data science tool//GA2//third.py`, `E://data science tool//GA3//second.py`, `E://data science tool//GA1//eighteenth.py`, `E://data science tool//GA4//sixth.py`, `E://data science tool//GA5//seventh.py`).
    *   "Score" values associated with each script (e.g., "score: 8.30", "score: 12.90", "score: 5.90", "score: 7.70", "score: 14.50"). This could represent a confidence score, accuracy, or relevance.
    *   Network activity. Each log entry includes a line like "93.158.43.17:0 - 'POST /ask HTTP/1.1' 200 OK". This indicates that the scripts are making POST requests, likely to a server to ask a question or perform some processing and receiving a '200 OK' response, meaning success.
    *   "Processing question:" lines followed by the question asked
        * LexiSolve Inc. is a startup that delivers a ...
        * There is a tickets table in a SQLite database that ...
        * Search using the Hacker News RSS API for the lates
        * As a data analyst at DataSure Technologies, you ha...
*   **File Path:** Towards the bottom, there is a line "file in query: C:\\Users\\hsent\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\unleash-repo-schema-v1-codeium-language-server.json".  This specifies the location of the configuration file.

**Other Notable Features:**

*   **Date and Time:** The lower right corner shows the date "06/04/2025" and the time "22:40".  This indicates the image was taken on or after April 6th, 2025.
*   **Device Branding:** The bottom left corner includes the text "REDMI NOTE 12". Also at the bottom corner we see the name of a laptop brand "DELL".
*   **Dust:** The laptop screen is visibly dusty and somewhat smudged.

**In summary:** The image captures a developer's workspace, showing the output of data science scripts. The scripts are likely involved in question-answering or information retrieval tasks using external APIs, with associated scores and network activity. The image also provides information about the environment, including the device model, a future date, and the presence of a configuration file.

Hello,

I wanted to provide an update regarding the issue I faced while I was in Jammu. During my stay, my laptop was on, but I encountered an error that caused my endpoint to crash. It seemed that Cloudflared mentioned needing an update, which I believe contributed to the problem.

Now that I’m back in Delhi, I’m connected to the internet, and I’m happy to report that my endpoint is working again.

see this image I have designed my endpoint to monitor with discord webhook

    *   ESPN Cricinfo has ODI batting stats for each batsman. The result is paginated across multiple pages...
    *   Source: Utilize IMDb's advanced web search at [https://www.imdb.com/search/title/](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/) to access movie data.

**IMDb Section:**

*   "IMDb" text
*   "Advanced search" text
*   A large yellow graphic with the IMDb logo in black.

**Alert/Status Section (Bottom):**

*   **ALERT: API Status - 2025-04-07 13:01:32** (Alert date and timestamp)
*   "The API at app.algsoch.tech is currently DOWN or experiencing issues." (Description of the issue)
*   **API is DOWN**
    *   Status: DOWN
    *   Last checked: 2025-04-07 13:01:32

**Overall Impressions:**

*   The image appears to be a dashboard or monitoring screen of some kind.
*   It shows details about requests, queries, and API status.
*   There's an alert indicating that an API at app.algsoch.tech is down.
*   The information points towards data analysis, likely involving movie information sourced from IMDb and potentially cricket stats from ESPN Cricinfo.

@Saransh\_Saini  
Sir, is my evaluation and project report generation completed.? can i also close the server?  
my roll no.23f3000975
Certainly! Let's analyze the image.

**Content:**

The image features a simple graphic of the uppercase letter "H".

*   **Letter:** The letter "H" is rendered in a clean, sans-serif font. It appears to be outlined and has a slight glow or blurred effect, giving it a soft, almost ethereal appearance.
*   **Color:** The letter itself appears to be white or a very light shade.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid shade of blue.

**In summary**, the image is a minimalist representation of the letter "H" against a blue background. There isn't any other text, objects, or contextual information present in the image.

@Saransh\_Saini  
Sir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests.

1. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response
2. When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests  
   a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response  
   b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307  
   whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/”

The logs from Cloud Run  

image982×552 133 KB

As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).

I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.

Thank you.  
Regards,  
Shivaditya
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout and Content**

The image shows a log or debugging output, likely from a web application or server. It's structured as a series of lines, each representing a logged event or request. Each line appears to have several fields, including:

*   **Timestamp:** The date and time of the event (e.g., "2025-04-05 23:51:12.872").
*   **Severity Level:** An indication of the event's importance (e.g., "INFO", a warning symbol (!), or no marking).
*   **HTTP Method:** (e.g., "POST", "GET")
*   **HTTP Status Code:** A numerical code indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., "302", "405", "200").
*   **Data Size:** The size of data transferred (e.g., "140 B", "156 B").
*   **Request Duration:** The time the request took (e.g., "0 ms", "1 ms", "2 ms", "509 ms").
*   **Originating IP Address and Port:** (e.g., "169.254.169.126:49510")
*   **Request Path:** The URL path being accessed (e.g., "/api").
*   **HTTP Version:** (e.g. HTTP/1.1)
*   **Message:** (e.g., "Method Not Allowed", "Temporary Redirect")
*   **Source:** The entity making the request (e.g., "python-reque.")
*   **Destination:** The URL that is being accessed (e.g., "http://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/", "https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/")

**Specific Observations**

*   **Time Range:** The logs span from April 5, 2025, at 23:51:12 to April 6, 2025, at 00:14:41.
*   **HTTP Methods Used:** Both "POST" and "GET" requests are present.
*   **Status Codes:**
    *   **302:** Found (Temporary Redirect). This often indicates a redirect to a different URL.
    *   **307:** Temporary Redirect.
    *   **405:** Method Not Allowed. This suggests the client is trying to use an HTTP method (like GET) on a resource that only accepts other methods (like POST).
    *   **200:** OK. Successful request.
*   **URL Pattern:** Many URLs follow the pattern `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/` or `http://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/`
*   **"python-reque..."**: Appears to be associated with many of the requests. It likely indicates that the requests are being made using a Python library or framework.
*   **Warnings:** Some lines are flagged with a warning icon (!), likely indicating errors or issues (like "Method Not Allowed").
*   **IP Addresses:** All the logs seem to be originating from a single IP Address: "169.254.169.126".

**Interpretation**

Based on the log data, it seems like there are potential issues with how the API is being accessed:

*   The "Method Not Allowed" errors suggest incorrect HTTP methods being used for certain endpoints.
*   The "Temporary Redirect" responses indicate the server is redirecting the client, potentially due to changes in the API structure or routing.
*   The last log with status code "200" indicates success.

In conclusion, the image captures a debugging or logging session that provides insights into web server request-response behavior and API accessibility. It shows potential errors related to wrong HTTP methods and redirects.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image is a screenshot of a Google Forms page, likely for submitting a project. The form has a simple, clean design with a light purple background.

**Header Section:**

*   **Title:** "TDS Project 2 - Jan 2025". This indicates the form is related to a project assignment due in January 2025.
*   **Instructions:** There are several lines of text providing instructions:
    *   "Please log in with your iitm.ac.in or your work email ID." This suggests that only students or employees associated with iitm.ac.in or a specific organization are allowed to submit the form.
    *   "You can submit only one response." This indicates that each person is limited to a single submission.
    *   "You can correct your response after you submit." This means respondents have the option to edit their submissions after initially sending them.
*   **Email Information:** "Your email (22f3000819@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded when you submitted this form." This confirms that the form automatically captures the submitter's email address.

**Question 1:**

*   **Question:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2? *"
    *   The asterisk (*) signifies that this is a required field.
    *   "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name" is an example of the required format.
*   **Answer:** `https://github.com/RichPerspective007/tds_p2` This is the user's GitHub repository link.

**Question 2:**

*   **Question:** "What is the link to your API endpoint? *"
    *   Again, the asterisk (*) indicates a required field.
    *   "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL" clarifies that the submitted API endpoint should be able to receive POST requests.
*   **Answer:** `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/` This is the user's API endpoint link.

**In summary:** The image shows a Google Forms submission for a project called "TDS Project 2".  The submitter is providing links to their GitHub repository and a working API endpoint for the project.

My IITM student dashboard on the portal shows absent for course project (COURSE PROJET - Absent). Is this referring to project 1 or 2? Coz i missed Project 1 but submitted Project 2 successfully. Also the logs show that the evaluation was performed on the submitted enpoint. So should I be concerned about the dashboard showing ‘Absent’ or will it be updated in a few days?

@Carlton @Saransh\_Saini, it would be helpful if you could specify a date — a clear deadline

---
We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.

This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)

@carlton Could you clarify if some kind of a normalisation will be done this time as well? Or if some bonus marks will be given? Last time, it didn’t help as much because the highest marks were 16.

Normalisation is only helpful when no one scores the top marks.

because laptop giving error because my system ran out of memory and because api working continuously more than 1 week
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image displays a webpage error message. At the top, there's a simple, pixelated graphic of a file folder with "X" marks where eyes would be, suggesting the folder is "dead" or unusable.  

Below the graphic, in a larger font, is the phrase "Aw, Snap!".

Underneath that, the text "Something went wrong while displaying this webpage." indicates the nature of the error.

Further down, it specifies the "Error code: Out of Memory", which clarifies the reason for the error.

Finally, at the bottom is a link that says "Learn more".

@carlton @Saransh\_Saini  
This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed.

Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation. In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).

Hello @Saransh\_Saini , @Jivraj  
Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,  
I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,  
As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,  
I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec … and thats why this happened , i guess

does it means , my LLM failed ??  
Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,  
You can check its working from interface too  
Please check once !!
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overview**
The image displays a dashboard or interface showing logs, function invocation details, and deployment information, possibly from a serverless platform like Vercel or similar. There are log entries related to API calls, function execution, and a failed workflow. A sidebar on the right provides additional information about the function invocation and deployment.

**Key Components**

1.  **Log Timeline**
    *   Two API calls are recorded:
        *   `APR 09 00:11:06.94 POST 504 tds-ga-proj2.ve... /api/`
        *   `APR 09 00:11:00.79 POST 307 tds-ga-proj2.ve... /api`
    *   There is an indication that no more logs are available within the selected timeline.

2.  **Log Entries Section**
    *   A section labeled "Logs" with a total count of "3 Total" logs.
    *   The logs are presumably generated by a "Vercel Function."
        *   `00:11:07.064 Email ID 23f1000598@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
        *   `00:11:07.112 Email updated in index.html`
        *   `00:11:07.149 X Failed to trigger workflow: 401 - ("message":"Bad credentials","documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest", "status":"401")`

3.  **Sidebar - Function Invocation Details**
    *   **Function Invocation:**  The primary section here.
    *   **Status:** Gateway Timeout `504`
    *   **Route:**  `/main.py` - The specific file or endpoint being executed.
    *   **Location:** Washington, D.C., USA (1ad1) - The geographical location of the execution environment.
    *   **Runtime:** Python 3.12 - The Python version used for the function.
    *   **Execution Duration/Maximum:** 10s / 10s - The function's actual and allowed execution time, suggesting a timeout.
    *   **Memory Used/Maximum:** 214 MB / 1024 MB - The memory usage of the function.
    *   **Response finished:** Indication that the function completed (possibly timed out)

4.  **Sidebar - Deployment Information**
    *   **Deployment ID:** `dpl_EFXAUNYSadoksLSimpbQCo5jo..` - A unique identifier for the deployment.
    *   **Environment:** `production` - The environment the deployment is running in.

5.  **Firewall Status**
    *   **Firewall:** Allowed

**In summary:** The image shows a function invocation that resulted in a Gateway Timeout (504). The function, `/main.py`, ran in Washington, D.C., using Python 3.12 and timed out after 10 seconds, despite using only 214MB of memory. One of the recent log entries highlights a failure to trigger a workflow due to bad credentials, which might be linked to the function's timeout issue. The function is deployed in a production environment.

We will be sending out emails to both sets. Ones who have to keep it on and ones who can shut it down. If you have not received a shutdown notice, assume that you have to keep it on. I apologise for the late reply, we ran into some unforeseen problems, hence the delay.

**Please allow some time for my server hosted on Render to initialize, as it may take a moment to become fully active.**  
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:** The image is a screenshot of an email. It appears to be a formal announcement addressed to a "Learner."

**Text Breakdown:**

*   **Greeting:** "Dear Learner,"
*   **Important Notice:** "Please do not ignore this important announcement. We are still doing some checks on the server endpoints for your TDS Project 2." This indicates a potential issue or ongoing activity related to a project called "TDS Project 2."
*   **Instructions:** "If you have turned it off because you were told that evaluations were complete, please turn them back on." This suggests that some learners might have shut down their systems or processes based on a previous notification about completion, but now need to reactivate them.
*   **Apology and Explanation:** "We apologise for the inconvenience caused. We aim to complete the evaluations as soon as possible and are cognizant that some of you are using up credits on azure and other platforms to keep them up and running." The senders acknowledge the disruption and highlight their awareness of the learners' potential resource consumption (Azure credits, etc.).
*   **Future Communication:** "We will inform you in subsequent emails when your evaluation is complete so that you do not have to keep them up and running longer than necessary." Learners are assured of receiving further updates when the evaluations are genuinely finished.
*   **Closing:** "Kind regards"

**Objects and Features:**

*   The text is formatted in a clear, readable font.
*   Important statements are bolded, signaling emphasis.
*   The layout is straightforward, typical of a professional email.

**In summary:** The image shows an announcement email informing learners about ongoing checks on a project, asking them to reactivate systems if previously deactivated, acknowledging the inconvenience, and promising future updates.
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of the Postman application, a tool used for testing APIs. It shows a POST request being configured and executed.

**Top Section:**

*   **Tabs:** Several tabs are visible at the top: "Untitled-1", "Untitled Request," and "https://fds-pro...". The active tab seems to be the one related to the "Untitled Request".
*   **HTTP Method:** A dropdown is visible with "POST" selected. This indicates the type of HTTP request being configured.
*   **Tabs for Request Details:** Underneath the method selection are tabs like "Params", "Authorization", "Headers (0)," "Body," "Pre-request Script," "Tests", and "Settings". The "Body" tab seems to be active.

**Query Parameters Section:**

*   There are empty fields for "Key" and "Value" under the "QueryParams" section. This suggests that no query parameters have been added to the request.

**Request Body Section:**

*   The "Body" section is active, showing a JSON payload.
*   The payload content is: `"answer": "160"`

**Response Section:**

*   **Tabs:** Tabs like "Body," "Cookies," "Headers (12)," and "Test Results" are visible. The "Body" tab is currently active.
*   **Body Format:** The "JSON" format is selected.
*   **Response Content:** The response body is shown as: `{"answer": "160"}`. This mirrors the request body indicating a possible echo service.
*   **Status and Timing:** In the bottom right corner, the response status, time, and size are visible:
    *   **Status:** 200 OK (indicating a successful request)
    *   **Time:** 53.13 s (response time)
    *   **Size:** 361 B (response size)

**Other Details:**

*   **Environment Selection:** There is a dropdown with "No Environment" selected.
*   **Save and Send Buttons:** A "Save" button and a "Send" button are located at the top right.
*   **Code and Cookies:** There are tabs for "Code" and "Cookies".

**Summary:**

The image depicts a successful POST request in Postman to an endpoint. The request and response body contain a simple JSON payload, and the status code indicates the request was successful, even though the request time was very slow.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:** The image depicts a terminal session on a computer.  It shows a `curl` command being executed and the subsequent output of that command.

**Command and Output:**

*   **`curl` Command:**
    *   `curl -X POST` - Indicates a `POST` request.
    *   `URL` - The URL is partially redacted (covered with green marker), but it ends with `/api/`.
    *   `-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"` - Sets the content type of the request, indicating it's sending form data.
    *   `-F "question=...` -  Specifies a form field named "question." The value is a long string that contains the following:
        *   Text explaining the purpose (checking formula writing in Google Sheets).
        *   The formula: `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 5, 2), 1, 10))`
        *   A question: "What is the result?"

*   **Output:**
    *   `{"answer":"140"}` - This is the response received from the server. It is a JSON object indicating that the "answer" to the question is "140".

**Other Details:**

*   **Username/Hostname:** `sahil@DESKTOP-N2T75TO` This is the username and hostname associated with the terminal session.
*   **Prompt:** `~$` This is the command prompt.

Just reply to the email that I have sent to you regarding your query. We will make exceptions for students facing this issue of having a changed end point due to the way ngrok works.

Kind regards

Humble Request to Update API Request Link
-----------------------------------------

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to kindly ask if it would be possible to update my API request link for project 2 in TDS. I realized that I mistakenly used the wrong endpoint in my earlier request.

**Previous API Request Link:**

project2llm-production.up.railway.app

### IITM Assignment API - Swagger UI

**Correct API Request Link:**  
https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/  
https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/

Would it be possible for you to allow me to make this change, or kindly update the link on my behalf? I sincerely apologize for the confusion, and I’d be truly grateful for your support and understanding.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
Pratyush Pulak Nishhank
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a logo. It's a simple, minimalist design.

**Elements:**

*   **Shape:** The logo is contained within a circular shape.
*   **Color:** The background color of the circle is a teal or dark turquoise.
*   **Symbol:** Inside the circle is a white stylized symbol. It resembles a slanted letter "F" or a lightning bolt. It has sharp angles and a dynamic, forward-leaning appearance.

**Key Features:**

*   **Simplicity:** The design is clean and straightforward, making it easily recognizable.
*   **Emphasis on Movement:** The slanted angle of the "F" or lightning bolt suggests energy, speed, or progress.
*   **Color Contrast:** The white symbol against the teal background provides good contrast, making the symbol stand out.

**Possible Interpretations:**

*   The "F" might stand for a company or brand name.
*   The lightning bolt suggests speed, technology, or electricity.

**In summary,** the image is a teal-colored circle with a white, stylized "F" or lightning bolt inside. It's a simple, modern logo design that likely represents a brand or company related to technology, speed, or something starting with the letter "F".

But Sir please give some bonus , As in earlier terms , everyone got S grade in TDS , without doing anything , and from this term the difficulty level increased rapidly , just like e^x  
Although I know that our LLM doesnt worked fully(100%) , but atleast they worked 50-60%  
We have learned so many things and try to implement in it too,…

Atleast give some bonus for our hardwork , and participating in both LLM project , so even we dont get S grade , but will get B , A , grade … and our CGPA doesn’t decrease much  
because projects hold the major chunk in grading

It seems you have provided a local address endpoint, which means it will only work on your computer. If I run it on my computer, it will redirect to my port 8000 if it is running.

@carlton,@Saransh\_Saini  
sir my roll number is 23f2004462

Due to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok’s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.

New project 2 url:- https://96c8-2401-4900-6290-6a14-b433-2faa-a056-a6e5.ngrok-free.app/api/

@carlton @Saransh\_Saini Respected sir, by mistake I have submitted the endpoint as : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/ while the corrected api which is deployed on vercel for direct requests is : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/  
The link provided is also working one but this link has the frontend part not the url endpoint.  
kindly evaluate me on the basis of the updated link : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/

Respected Course Team,

Harsh this side from NIT Allahabad, I am writing to inform you that I received a notification  

image2096×1154 160 KB

  
regarding an issue with my submission.

I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel  
https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app  
and the correct API endpoint is:

correct api : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/

Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don’t want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of an email. The email is about an important announcement regarding Project 2, presumably from a course called "TDS".

**Email Header:**

*   **Subject:** \[TDS Jan 25] Important announcement regarding Project 2
*   **Sender:** 22t1 se2002 <se2002@study.iitm.ac.in> (This looks like an email address from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras).
*   **Recipient:** "to me" (indicating the current user's inbox).
*   **Timestamp:** 2:26 AM (20 hours ago).
*   There are standard email icons for starring, replying, forwarding, and more options.

**Email Body:**

*   **Greeting:** "Dear Learner,"
*   **Content:**
    *   A request not to ignore the announcement.
    *   Indicates that checks are still being done on the server endpoints for the TDS Project 2.
    *   Instructs recipients to turn back on their project if they had turned it off based on the belief that evaluations were complete.
    *   An apology for the inconvenience. The team aims to complete evaluations as soon as possible.
    *   Acknowledgement that some learners are using up credits on Azure and other platforms to keep the project running.
    *   Promise to inform in subsequent emails when the evaluation is complete.
*   **Closing:**
    *   "Kind regards, TDS Team"
*   **Note:**  "Do NOT reply to this email. It is only meant for official announcements and messages. If you need any further assistance please contact the course team via Discourse."

**Email Footer:**

*   An "Unsubscribe" link.

Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Context:**

*   The image shows a computer screen displaying a Google Colaboratory (Colab) notebook.
*   The notebook seems to be designed for a data processing task.
*   There is a reCAPTCHA challenge mentioned in the top portion of the image.

**Code Snippets:**

*   **URL:** `url = "https://tds-project-2-ruby.vercel.app/api/"`
    *   This line defines a variable `url` pointing to a web API. It likely sends requests to this API.

*   **Files:** `files = {'file': open(r'q-unicode-data.zip', 'rb')}`
    *   This section specifies a file to be opened, presumably for upload to the API.
    *   The file being opened is `q-unicode-data.zip` in read-binary (`'rb'`) mode.

*   **Data Payload:** `data = { "question': """...""" }`
    *   This part defines the data to be sent to the API.
    *   The main part of the data is a "question" which explains the task.

    *   The task is:
        *   To download and process the files in `q-unicode-data.zip`, which contains three files with different encodings.
        *   The three files are:
            *   `data1.csv`: CSV file encoded in CP-1252
            *   `data2.csv`: CSV file encoded in UTF-8
            *   `data3.txt`: Tab-separated file encoded in UTF-16
        *   Each file has 2 columns: symbol and value.
        *   The question is to sum up all the values where the symbol matches `< OR $ OR >` across all three files.
        *   Then find what is the sum of all values associated with these symbols?

*   **Request and Response:**
    *   `response = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)`
        *   This line uses the `requests` library to send a POST request to the defined URL, including the specified files and data.
    *   `print(response.status_code)`
        *   This line prints the HTTP status code of the response (e.g., 200 for success).
    *   `print(response.text)`
        *   This line prints the text content of the response.

*   **Response Content:** `200 ("answer":39961}`
    *   The API returns a status code of 200, which typically means success.
    *   The API also returns a JSON-like string indicating the answer to the question: `("answer":39961}`

**Other Features:**

*   **File Menu:** Visible are options like "File", "Edit", "View", "Insert", "Runtime", "Tools", and "Help," consistent with the Colab interface.
*   **System Tray:** The bottom right shows system tray information, including the time and a "36°C Haze" indicator, likely related to weather or environment.
*   **Search Bar:** The "Type here to search" bar is visible at the bottom left.
*   **reCAPTCHA:** At the very top, there is a message related to a reCAPTCHA challenge and the internet connection.

**Interpretation:**

This Colab notebook is designed to automate a data processing task. It downloads a zip file, reads data from CSV and text files with different encodings, filters data based on specified symbols ("<", "$", ">"), and then calculates and sends the sum of the associated values to an API. The API returns the answer, which is printed in the notebook.

Do all of us have to give the latest project link or only those whose links have actually changed. @Saransh\_Saini @carlton @Jivraj.

Basically should we resubmit the link using the form sent today if our link has not changed?

PS: Maybe send a mail to everyone to update the access of their GA7 links to viewer for everyone at IIT Madras.

Just submit whatever is the latest working link. You do not have to submit a new form if you have received an email that said your evaluation was completed.

Dear Sirs,

Most of us have hosted our projects in Azure and this is costing us real money .. We have just gotten to a stage where if you could just please let us know if our endpoints have been evaluated and there is some score we will happily take it down.  
Kindly bear in mind the there is a financial component ( some of us have free accounts ) involved here and I urge and request you to kindly expedite the evaluation process so that we decrease the financial burden placed upon us by this exercise…

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
Sir, please confirm me whether I have been evaluated or not. Because my azure balance is reducing day by day.

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.  
However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.

The exact url I gave ends with “/api/” but every POST request was either made to “/api” which resulted in a 307 response or with “http” instead of “https” which resulted in a 302 response. Only the get requests were made to the correct endpoint but since the app was supposed to allow POST requests only, making GET requests just resulted in 405.  

10001508681080×2340 242 KB

I request you to use the exact url I gave in the gform and make POST requests to it to re-evaluate me. I gave the exact url as asked in the form.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Content**

The image is a screenshot of a mobile phone display. The phone screen shows a Google Cloud Console webpage, specifically the "Logs" section for a service named "tdpproject2shiva." The logs displayed are related to activities within the application.

**Key Textual Elements**

*   **Top Bar:** The very top of the screen shows phone status indicators like time (12:16), network connection, battery percentage (82%), etc.
*   **Browser Address Bar:** The browser address bar displays "cloud.google.com".
*   **Google Cloud Console Header:**  The top of the Google Cloud Console displays the Google Cloud logo, links to resources, a search bar, and user settings.
*   **Cloud Run Service Details:** The page shows details for "Cloud Run" service. A link to "Set up Continuous Deployment" is also visible.
*   **Service Name:** "tdpproject2shiva" is the name of the Cloud Run service.
*   **Log Tabs:**  The page shows tabs for "Logs", "Metrics", "Revisions", and "Triggers". The "Logs" tab is currently selected.
*   **Search Bar:** There is a search bar with the placeholder text "Search all fields and values."
*   **Log Entries:** A list of log entries is the main content. Each entry shows the following information (based on a sampling of the visible entries):
    *   **Timestamp:** Date and time of the log entry (e.g., "2023-09-06 15:17:38.884 UTC").
    *   **Severity:**  Indicates the level of the log message (e.g., "INFO", "DEBUG").
    *   **Message:**  The actual log message. This varies, but common patterns include:
        *   HTTP requests (e.g., "GET /api/v1.0/ HTTP/1.1" , "POST /api/v1.0/ HTTP/1.1")
        *   Python requests (e.g., "python-requests/2.32.2")
        *   Status codes (e.g., "405 Method Not Allowed", "307 Temporary Redirect")
        *   Various application states ("processing question", "trying to load", "started server process", "application starting complete")
*   **Navigation Buttons:** The bottom of the screen displays standard Android navigation buttons (Back, Home, Overview/Multitasking).

**Objects and Visual Features**

*   The screenshot is taken from a mobile phone, as indicated by the top and bottom bars of the screen.
*   The Google Cloud Console interface is visible in a typical web layout.
*   The log entries are presented in a table-like format.
*   The overall color scheme is the standard Google Cloud Console blue and white.

**Interpretation**

The image shows a developer monitoring the logs of a Cloud Run application. The logs contain information about HTTP requests, potential errors (like "405 Method Not Allowed"), and the application's internal state. The developer is likely using the logs to debug or monitor the application's behavior.
 Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of an email on a mobile phone, likely an Android device. The email appears to be part of a form or survey, possibly related to a software development project.

**Key Elements & Text:**

*   **Top Section:**
    *   **GitHub Link:**  `https://github.com/RichPerspective007/tds_p2` This indicates a public repository on GitHub, possibly containing code or project files.

*   **Central Question:**
    *   **Question Text:** "What is the link to your API endpoint?"  This is the main question being asked in the email.
    *   **Instruction:** "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL."  This emphasizes the need for a valid and functional API endpoint that can handle POST requests.
    *   **API Endpoint URL:** `https://tdsproject2shiva-962709320549.asia-south1.run.app/api/` This is the likely answer to the question, a URL pointing to a Google Cloud Run deployment located in the Asia South 1 region.

*   **Lower Section:**
    *   **Google Forms:**  "Create your own Google Form". This suggests the email might have been generated from a Google Form.
    *   **Suspicion Prompt:**  "Does this form look suspicious? Report". This indicates a built-in mechanism for users to report potentially malicious or misleading forms.

*   **Email Actions:**
    *   **Reply, Reply all, Forward:** Standard email action buttons.

*   **Footer:**
    *   "No add-ons available for this email" - indicates the email does not have any custom add-ons active.

*   **Device Status Bar:**
    *   **Time:** 12:23
    *   **Network:** Mobile data and Wi-Fi symbols are present.
    *   **Battery:** 81% charged.

*   **Navigation Bar:**
    *   Standard Android navigation buttons (back, home, recent apps).
    *   Email inbox with 99+ messages
    *   8 unread messages

**In summary:** The image shows an email questionnaire asking for an API endpoint, with the likely answer provided. The email includes a link to a GitHub repository and a prompt to report any suspicious activity, indicating a degree of security awareness. The email is likely part of a Google Form.

@Saransh\_Saini @carlton  
Hello sir,  
I apologize for bothering you again.  
About 30 minutes ago, I received an email stating that project 2 has been evaluated. However, when I checked my IP stats, I found there is no special API access. You can verify this. I want to understand whether this is just a wrong email I received or if there is an issue with your system’s evaluation. Please clarify this doubt, as I am unable to focus on my final term exam.  
i closed my local machine too I spent one month on this project please consider my problem

image706×592 10.1 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a terminal output from a Python script named "uniu.py". It shows the results of analyzing network traffic, specifically related to IP addresses and their interactions with an "/api/" endpoint.

**Textual Content and Analysis:**

1.  **Command Prompt:** The top line shows the command executed:
    *   `PS E:\data science tool\main\grok> python uniu.py`
    *   This indicates the script "uniu.py" was executed using Python from a specific directory.

2.  **Initial Output:**
    *   `Found 5 unique IP addresses:`
    *   The script has identified 5 distinct IP addresses involved in the analyzed activity.

3.  **IP Address Details (Repeated for each IP):**
    *   `IP: [IP Address]` (e.g., `IP: 43.230.106.157`)
    *   `Accessed endpoints: /api/`
    *   `API endpoint access count: [Number]` (e.g., `API endpoint access count: 93`)
    *   This section provides information for each of the 5 unique IP addresses, indicating that they all accessed the "/api/" endpoint, and the number of times they accessed it.

4.  **Summary Information:**
    *   `Total /api/ endpoint calls: 262`
    *   `IPs accessing /api/ endpoint: 5`
    *   The script provides the total number of calls to the "/api/" endpoint (262) and confirms that 5 unique IP addresses were involved in accessing this endpoint.

**Specific IP Addresses and Access Counts:**

*   43.230.106.157: Access count 93
*   52.234.41.123: Access count 48
*   20.42.17.59: Access count 39
*   20.57.44.194: Access count 43
*   172.183.175.198: Access count 39

**Interpretation:**

The "uniu.py" script likely parsed some log data or network traffic data. It identified the number of unique IPs that accessed the "/api/" endpoint, the count of accesses to the endpoint of each IP and a total of how many requests occurred to that endpoint. The highest number of accesses was made by the IP "43.230.106.157".

I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint instead of the /api/ endpoint that I specifically gave in the google forms.

To confirm this I also sent a request to /api and /api/ enpoints and the /api gave a 404 error while /api/ gave a 200 message.

Please look into this

where did you check it?

Also, on https://www.vercel-status.com/ this is showing  
**Update** - npm have released a status page incident, and users can monitor further updates here: https://status.npmjs.org  
Apr 11, 2025 - 03:02 UTC

**Monitoring** - We have observed authentication issues to private registries using npm access tokens. Affected users may see 4xx errors when installing private packages. Manually regenerating tokens appears to resolve this issue. At this time, there is no official statement from npm or GitHub regarding the root cause.  
Apr 11, 2025 - 02:37 UTC
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image contains a single letter "S" in white, set against a dark grayish-blue (almost slate-like) background.

**Features:**

*   **Letter "S":** The letter is in lowercase and appears to be rounded, potentially in a font like Arial or Helvetica. It is well-lit and stands out clearly against the darker background.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid color, providing a contrasting backdrop that emphasizes the letter.
*   **Focus:** The letter is the main, if not the only, subject in the image, and is presumably in focus.
*   **Overall Impression:** The image has a clean and minimalist aesthetic due to its simplicity.

@carlton @Jivraj  
Dear Sir,  
In my course dashboard, it shows project 2 status as absent, but i have already submitted the repo and api points well before deadline in the given forum. Still my vercel server is running and api is resolving as expected. Please look into this matter, because I already had issue in my project 1 and lost marks in that. Expecting a positive response from your end.

@carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj  
Hello Sir, my project 2 score is showing as 0. I had got email saying please update endpoint because earlier endpoint was having problems. I had sent https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/ as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint?

Namaste Sir. The projects have been quite challenging, and I have applied my knowledge to the best of my ability. I’ve submitted the project but it’s showing 0 in the portal. Bonus marks for creating APIs and so in the projects would be greatly appreciated. I am planning to start my degree in the upcoming term, and this is the last subject I am completing at this level. So, I kindly request your assistance, sir.

Hello Sir,  
For me as well Project 2 scores are showing 0.I have spent alot of time and effort in this project. Please look into it.

@carlton @Saransh\_Saini sir ,  
I am writing to kindly request a re-evaluation of my Project 2 submission. As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately **50 to 60 seconds** to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both **Podman** and **Linux** environments.

Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on **Railway** and submitted that link as well.

If possible, I kindly request either of the following:

1. Re-evaluation using the **Railway link** I provided, or
2. Re-evaluation using the **Render link**, with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time.

Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.

Thank you for your support and guidance.

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini I knew that this affected my project 2 score and that’s why I made that post(the one to which I’m replying in this message). Please look into this. My api is working and still on and will be on till 18th April when my credits will run out. Please re-evaluate my project 2 with the exact url I gave in the form. My project 2 was evaluated on the wrong url and this led to a zero in the project 2 score.

Hi sir @carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

**Server is running and reachable. and Giving Correct Answers**  
 **GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code**, both return **200 OK**.  
 **Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people** – all received correct results.  
 **No issues seen in logs or deployment** – everything was set up properly.  
 **Others in my group got full marks** – we worked on the same project.

**I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.**  
 **I’ve spent weeks working on this project**, including sleepless nights.  
 **This is my last term** – if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

* **API Documentation:** FastAPI - Swagger UI
* **API Endpoint:** http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I’ve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

as you can see my vm is working fine here

Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a single graphic element: a check mark symbol. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Shape:** The overall shape is a square with rounded corners.
*   **Color Palette:** The square is green, likely a medium or light shade of green. The check mark itself is white.
*   **Symbol:** The check mark is centrally located within the square, diagonally oriented.
*   **Styling:** It appears the square has a glossy or slightly three-dimensional effect, which creates some shading and highlights. This gives the icon a bit of visual depth.

In summary, the image is a green square icon with a white check mark. It's a common visual representation of "yes," "correct," "approved," or "completed."
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image contains a green square with a white checkmark inside. The square has rounded corners and appears to have a slight gloss or sheen effect, making it look like a button or icon. The checkmark is a simple, slightly stylized design.

**Key Features:**

*   **Color:** Predominantly green and white.
*   **Shape:** Square with rounded corners. Checkmark is a "V" shape.
*   **Texture:** Appears glossy or shiny.
*   **Symbolism:** The checkmark typically represents affirmation, completion, correctness, or approval.
*   **Potential Use:** The image is likely an icon or a symbol used to indicate completion of a task, agreement, correctness, or a positive response. It could be found in software interfaces, forms, lists, or presentations.
 Certainly! Let's analyze the image.

**Content Description:**

The image contains a single element: a **green square with a white check mark inside.**

 Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image is a screenshot of a Microsoft Azure portal displaying a "Serial console" session for a virtual machine named "shashitdsproject2". The left sidebar provides navigation options within the Azure portal. The main part of the screen shows a terminal window with command-line activity.

**Top Navigation Bar:**

*   Typical browser elements like tabs, back/forward buttons, address bar (showing a URL related to the Azure portal and education), and user account information.
*   An Azure-specific search bar.
*   The "Copilot" icon.
*   Information about the signed-in user and the default directory.

**Left Sidebar:**

*   Navigation options: "console" (appears selected), "Connect", "Help", "Boot diagnostics", and "Serial console".

**Main Content Area (Terminal Window):**

*   A code snippet defining an asynchronous function "process\_request" likely related to an API endpoint. It takes a "question" (string) and an optional file upload as input.
*   A series of commands and output from a Linux-based terminal.

    *   "sudo systemctl restart nginx": An attempt to restart the Nginx web server, but "sudo" is not recognized as a command (likely due to a PATH issue).
    *   "sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start uvicorn && sudo systemctl enable uvicorn": Commands to reload the systemd daemon, start the Uvicorn server, and enable it to start on boot. These commands are being repeated multiple times in the next line.
    *   "systemctl status uvicorn": Checks the status of the Uvicorn service. The output shows:
        *   "uvicorn.service - Uvicorn FastAPI Server": Description of the service.
        *   "Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/uvicorn.service; enabled; preset: enabled)": Indicates that the service is loaded and enabled.
        *   "Active: active (running)": Shows that the service is currently running.
        *   "since Mon 2025-04-14 09:35:04 UTC": Specifies when the service started running.
        *   Other details about the process ID, memory usage, CPU usage, and the command used to start the service.
    *   Log messages from Uvicorn, including:
        *   Warning messages about a "slow pur".
        *   A warning about not finding ffmpeg.
        *   Information about the server process starting, application startup, and Uvicorn running.
*   The command prompt `shashi@shashitdsproject2:~/GASolver$`.

**Key Observations:**

*   The virtual machine is likely set up to run a FastAPI application served by Uvicorn and potentially using Nginx as a reverse proxy (though there's an initial error with Nginx).
*   The Uvicorn service appears to be successfully started and running.
*   There are some warning messages, but the application seems to be functioning.

I kindly request you to review my submission
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image depicts a single link in a chain.
*   The link is light blue with some darker blue shading to give it a three-dimensional appearance.
*   It is rendered in a pixelated style, suggesting it's either a low-resolution image or deliberately made to look like pixel art.
*   The background is black, which makes the blue link stand out.
*   The link is oriented diagonally, with one end pointing upwards and to the left and the other pointing downwards and to the right.

**Object and Features:**

*   **Chain Link:** The central and only object in the image is a chain link. This signifies connection, strength, or potentially a symbol for a hyperlink in a digital context.

**Possible Interpretations:**

*   The image likely symbolizes a connection or link, especially in a digital context, similar to the hyperlink icon.

Dear Sir,

In my course dashboard, Project 2 score is shown as zero. However, I had submitted the repository and API endpoints (http://35.192.157.22.80) through the Google Form. I had received a mail to make edit in API end point if changed. I had edited my api end point by adding /api/ and it was http://35.192.157.22/api/. My server was running fine. I have worked hard to do this project and now receiving a score of zero. Kindly look into it.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content Overview:**

The image shows a code editor (likely VS Code) containing a Python script and its output in a terminal. The script sends a POST request to a FastAPI server. The server processes a question about ticket sales and returns a SQL query as the answer.

**Code Editor Details:**

*   **File Name:** The script is named "burima.py".
*   **Libraries:** The `requests` library is imported.
*   **FastAPI URL:** A URL is defined for the FastAPI server: `"http://16.16.189.187:8000/tdsp2"`.
*   **Form Data:** A dictionary `data` is created, containing a key "question". The value of "question" is a raw string containing a question asking for the SQL query to calculate total sales of "Gold" tickets.
*   **File Handling:** A dictionary `files` is created. This contains the file "q-fastapi.csv" which is being opened in binary read mode ('rb'). Its content type is set as "text/plain".
*   **POST Request:** The `requests.post` function is used to send a POST request to the specified URL. The code is written `response = requests.post(url, data=data) #files=files`, however, files are being used, the `files` parameter should be used instead of `data`.

**Terminal Output Details:**

*   **Command Execution:** The command `python burima.py` is executed in the PowerShell terminal.
*   **Status Code:** The HTTP status code 200 (OK) is returned by the server, indicating success.
*   **Response JSON:** The response from the server is a JSON object containing an "answer" field. The value of "answer" is the SQL query: `"SELECT SUM(units * price) AS total_sales FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';"`

**In Summary:**

The image depicts a Python script that interacts with a FastAPI server to generate an SQL query. The script sends a question regarding ticket sales, and the server returns the corresponding SQL query to answer the question. The query calculates the sum of (units \* price) for all tickets where the lowercase trimmed ticket type is 'gold'.
 Here is a detailed description of the content of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a command-line interface or terminal, displaying log messages. The text is in a monospaced font, typical of such interfaces, and the background is black with white text. The messages are categorized into two types: "INFO" and "WARNING".

**Log Message Structure:**

Each log message starts with either "INFO:" or "WARNING:".

*   **INFO messages:**
    *   Followed by an IP address and port number (e.g., `103.158.43.17:17624`).
    *   Followed by an HTTP request in quotes (e.g., `"POST /tdsp2 HTTP/1.1"`)
    *   Followed by an HTTP status code and message (e.g., `200 OK` or `404 Not Found`).
*   **WARNING messages:**
    *   Indicate "Invalid HTTP request received."

**Specific Log Entries:**

Here is a breakdown of the specific log entries in the image:

1.  `INFO: 103.158.43.17:17624 - "POST /tdsp2 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` - An HTTP POST request to `/tdsp2` was successful (status code 200 OK).
2.  `INFO: 3.138.153.199:41458 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found` - An HTTP GET request to `/` was not found (status code 404 Not Found).
3.  `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`
4.  `INFO: 3.138.153.199:42404 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found` - Another HTTP GET request to `/` was not found (status code 404 Not Found).
5.  `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`
6.  `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`
7.  `INFO: 147.185.132.39:64970 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`
8.  `INFO: 5.79.219.172:42842 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`
9.  `INFO: 109.117.240.53:57966 - "GET / HTTP/1.0" 404 Not Found`
10. `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`
11. `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`
12. `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`
13. `INFO: 198.235.24.68:57798 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`
14. `INFO: 167.94.138.61:60428 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`
15. `INFO: 167.94.138.61:60492 - "PRI %2A HTTP/2.0" 404 Not Found`
16. `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`
17. `INFO: 167.94.138.61:35668 - "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`
18. `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`
19. `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`
20. `INFO: 45.43.33.210:38675 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`
21. `WARNING: Invalid HTTP request received.`

**Observations:**

*   Many of the "INFO" messages indicate that HTTP GET requests resulted in a "404 Not Found" error, suggesting that the requested resources were not available on the server.
*   There are multiple "WARNING" messages, indicating invalid HTTP requests were received, without more information on why.
*   There is a "PRI %2A HTTP/2.0" request.
*   There is a request of /favicon.ico.

Overall, the image represents a server log, indicating web requests and their responses, along with warnings about invalid requests.
 Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Content Overview:**

The image displays a snippet of Python code, likely from a web application framework such as FastAPI or similar. It defines an asynchronous function decorated with a route definition.

**Detailed Description:**

1.  **Decorator:**
    *   `@app.post("/tdsp2")`: This line indicates that the function being defined below is associated with a POST request to the URL endpoint "/tdsp2". `@app.post` is a decorator used in web frameworks to map a function to a specific HTTP method (POST in this case) and URL.

2.  **Function Definition:**
    *   `async def tdsp2(question: str = Form(...), file: Optional [UploadFile] = File (None)):`: This defines an asynchronous function named `tdsp2`. Let's break down the function's parameters:
        *   `question: str = Form(...)`: This parameter expects a string input named "question". It is received through a "Form" type and is likely required. The `...` likely signifies that the Form input is mandatory.
        *   `file: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None)`: This parameter expects a file input named "file". The `Optional[UploadFile]` annotation suggests the `file` parameter can be either an `UploadFile` object or `None` (meaning it's optional).  `File(None)` sets the default value of the file parameter to `None`, indicating that the user doesn't necessarily have to provide a file.

**In summary, the code snippet defines an API endpoint at `/tdsp2` that expects a POST request. The request should include a required string field called `question` and an optional file upload called `file`.**

I noticed that my Project 2 status is currently marked as “Absent” in the course dashboard. However, I would like to clarify that I \*\*submitted the GitHub repository and Vercel API link well before the deadline  
via the designated forum.

Additionally, my **Vercel server is still active**, and the API is functioning correctly, which can be verified here:  
 API Form Submission

I also have a **response copy from the forum confirming my submission**, including both the GitHub and Vercel links, as proof. I kindly request you to review this and take the necessary steps to update my project status.

Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Image Content:**

The image displays a stylized representation of a single chain link. 

*   **Object:** The primary object is a chain link, rendered in a somewhat glossy and simplistic style.
*   **Color:** The link appears to be light blue with darker blue shades, suggesting a metallic or plastic material with reflected light.
*   **Shape:** It's an elongated oval shape with a circular cross-section, typical of a chain link. The end of one side is interlocked with the adjacent segment.
*   **Context:** The link is presented against a solid black background.

**Possible Interpretations and Uses:**

This image could represent:

*   A connection or linkage.
*   The concept of unity or strength derived from interconnectedness.
*   A digital representation of a hyperlink or a file link.

Let me know if you'd like a more detailed analysis!
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image shows a section of what appears to be a Google Form. The form has a light purple background. It's part of a larger form, as indicated by "5 of 118" at the top right.

**Questions and Answers:**

There are two questions visible on the screen, along with the answers provided.

*   **Question 1:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2?" This question has a red asterisk, indicating it is required.

    *   It includes a hint: "It should look like [https://github.com/user-name/repository-name](https://github.com/user-name/repository-name)"
    *   **Answer 1:** "[https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2](https://github.com/itskaiffazal/tdsproject2)"

*   **Question 2:** "What is the link to your API endpoint?" This question also has a red asterisk, indicating it is required.

    *   It includes a note: "Make sure we can send a POST request to this exact URL"
    *   **Answer 2:** "[https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/](https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/)"

**Footer Information:**

At the bottom, there's text related to Google Forms:

*   "Create your own Google Form"
*   "Does this form look suspicious? Report"

In summary, the image presents a portion of a Google Form requesting links to a GitHub repository and an API endpoint, presumably related to a "Project 2". The form emphasizes the necessity of providing an exact URL for the API endpoint that accepts POST requests.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Form Elements:**

*   **Title:**  "Submit Your Question" appears at the top, indicating the form's purpose.
*   **Question Field:**
    *   Label: "Question:" precedes a large, empty text area where the user can type in their question.
*   **File Upload (Optional):**
    *   Label: "Upload ZIP File (optional):" suggests an option to upload a ZIP file.
    *   "Choose File" button. Next to it, the text "No file chosen" indicates that no file has been selected yet.
*   **Submit Button:** A blue button labeled "Submit" to send the form.

**Webpage Address:**

*   The URL `tdsproject2.vercelapp/api/` is visible in the browser's address bar. This likely indicates the form is part of a web application hosted on Vercel.

**In Summary:** The image presents a clean and straightforward form for submitting questions, with an optional file upload feature. The webpage is part of a web application hosted on Vercel.

Dear Sir, @carlton @Jivraj  
I need your immediate attention regarding my **project-2 , as I received zero marks,** but **my server is running completely fine**. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

Server is running and reachable. and Giving The Correct Answers

GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK.

Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people – all received correct results.

No issues seen in logs or deployment – everything was set up properly.

Others in my group got full marks – we worked on the same project.

I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.

I’ve spent weeks working on this project, including sleepless nights.  
Cant have least scores despite all the efforts.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:  
**API Documentation: FastAPI - Swagger UI**

**I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.  
I’ve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.  
Please don’t ignore this.  
Thanks,

*   **Input Area:** This is where a user inputs data. Fields include "question," "file," and a button to "Execute" the process.
*   **Response Area:** This section displays the results of the executed code. Sub-sections include "Curl" command, "Request URL," "Server Response" (including Code and Details), and the "Response Body."

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Question Input:**
    *   The "question" field is a string input, marked as "required."
    *   The example text input in the "question" field is: "Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY\_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 9, 11), 1, 10)) what is this formula"

*   **File Input:**
    *   There is a "file" upload section.
    *   The UI indicates "No file chosen."

*   **Action Buttons:**
    *   "Execute": Runs the query using the provided inputs.
    *   "Clear": Clears any input fields.

*   **Curl Command:**
    *   `curl -X "POST"`: Indicates a POST request is used to send data.
    *   `"https://bhavanapro.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api/"`: The API endpoint where the request is sent.
    *   `-H "accept: application/json"`: Sets the Accept header, indicating the client expects JSON responses.
    *   `-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"`: Sets the Content-Type header, indicating the request body is a multipart form (likely including the question string).
    *   `-F 'question=Let's make sure you can write formulas in Google Sheets. Type this formula into Google Sheets. (It won't work in Excel) =SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 9, 11), 1, 10)) what is this formula'`: Sends the question string within the Curl command.

*   **Request URL:**
    *   `https://bhavanapro.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`:  The API endpoint.

*   **Server Response:**
    *   **Code:** "200": This is the HTTP status code, indicating a successful request.

*   **Response Body:**
    *   `{ "answer": 585 }`: The server's response is a JSON object with a key "answer" that has a value of 585.

**Key Observations:**

*   The interface appears to be interacting with an API that evaluates Google Sheets formulas.
*   The query includes a specific formula: `=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 9, 11), 1, 10))`
*   The system successfully evaluated the formula and returned an answer of 585.

Let me know if you would like a more specific breakdown of any area or element!

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh\_Saini

My marks are also showing as zero.

My suggestion is to provide students with the logs of your evaluation script, so we know if it is that server was not reachable, the answer is incorrect, or the response format was incorrect..etc

Request you to let us know if there is going to be re-evaluation so we can get the Azure instance running again

    *   Adobe Acrobat Reader
    *   QuickBooks
*   **Wallpaper:** The wallpaper is orange and yellow abstract

**Keyboard**

*   The keyboard is black and appears to be a modern Apple keyboard.
*   The function keys (F1-F7) are visible.

**Inferences and Context**

*   **Software Development:**  The presence of VS Code, GitHub Desktop, and the "/api/" endpoint in the logs strongly suggests the person is developing or debugging a web application or API.
*   **Network Testing/Debugging:** The ngrok URL indicates the use of ngrok, a service that exposes local servers to the internet.  This is often used for testing webhooks or APIs running locally.
*   **Request Behavior:** The alternating "307 Temporary Redirect" and "200 OK" status codes suggest that the API is redirecting some requests, while others are being processed successfully. This could be due to routing logic, authentication, or other server-side behavior.

In summary, the image provides a snapshot of a software developer working on a web application or API, potentially debugging network requests using tools like ngrok and analyzing HTTP status codes.
 Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on textual and relevant features:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image shows a screenshot of VS Code (Visual Studio Code), a popular code editor.
*   The interface is divided into several sections:
    *   **Left Sidebar:** Contains the Explorer panel, which displays the project's directory structure.
    *   **Main Editor Window:** Displays the `main.py` file open for editing.
    *   **Bottom Panel:** Shows tabs for Problems, Output, Debug Console, and Terminal. The Terminal tab is currently active.

**Explorer Panel (Left Sidebar):**

*   Project name: `TDS-PROJECT-2.2`
*   Project Directory Structure:
    *   `app`: Contains files related to the application.
        *   `__pycache__`
        *   `utils`
            *   `__pycache__`
            *   `file_handler.py`
        *   `functions.py`
        *   `openal_client.py`
        *   `main.py`

    *   `Answers.json`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `README.md`
    *   `requirements.txt`
    *   `server.py`

**Main Editor Window (main.py):**

*   This window displays the content of the `main.py` file, which appears to be a Python script using the FastAPI framework.
*   Key Imports:
    *   `fastapi` (FastAPI, File, UploadFile, Form, HTTPException)
    *   `fastapi.middleware.cors` (CORSMiddleware)
    *   `typing` (Optional)
    *   `app.utils.openal_client` (get_openal_response)
    *   `app.utils.file_handler` (save_upload_file_temporarily)
*   Code Snippets:
    *   `app = FastAPI(title="IITH Assignment API")`
    *   CORS Middleware Configuration
        *   `allow_origins=["*"]`
        *   `allow_credentials=True`

    ```
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F question="How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?"
    ```

*   Output: `{"answer":"1121"}`

**Interpretation:**

*   The image depicts a developer working on a FastAPI application named "IITH Assignment API".
*   The code likely handles questions related to date ranges, as indicated by the `process_question` function and the query submitted through the terminal.
*   The `curl` command posts a question to the API running on `http://localhost:8000/api/`. The question asks for the number of Wednesdays between August 6, 1986, and January 29, 2008.
*   The API responds with `{"answer":"1121"}`, suggesting that there are 1121 Wednesdays in the specified date range.

**In summary, the image shows the development process of a FastAPI application where a user queries the API to find the number of Wednesdays within a given date range, and the API provides the answer "1121".**
 Here's a breakdown of the image's content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant details:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image shows a software development environment. It seems to be a combination of a code editor (likely VS Code) and a terminal window.

**Code Editor (VS Code):**

*   **Sidebar (Left):**  The "EXPLORER" panel shows the project's file structure. The project is named "TDS-PROJECT-2.2."  Key directories visible are "app," "utils," and "tests."  Individual files listed include: "file\_handler.py", "functions.py", "openai\_client.py", "main.py", "Answers.json," "README.md," and "server.py."
*   **Code Editor (Center):**  The file "main.py" is open. It's a Python file.  Key imports are visible:
    *   `fastapi` (likely the FastAPI web framework)
    *   `File`, `UploadFile`, `Form`, `HTTPException` from `fastapi`
    *   `CORSMiddleware` from `fastapi.middleware.cors`
    *   `os` (for operating system interactions)
    *   `Optional` from `typing`
    *   Functions from `app.utils.openai_client` (`get_openai_response`) and `app.utils.file_handler` (`save_upload_file_temporarily`).
*   **Bottom Bar:**  Indicates:
    *   Cursor position: Ln 1, Col 1
    *   Spaces: 4
    *   Encoding: UTF-8
    *   Line endings: LF
    *   Python version: 3.13.2
    *   "Go Live" (Likely related to a live server or debugging session)

**Terminal Window:**

*   **Title Bar:** Shows the terminal is "gauravghodge - ngrok http 8000 - 80x24" and indicates a Z shell.  The "ngrok" suggests a tunnel to expose a local server to the internet.
*   **Terminal Content:**
    *   `Last login: Tue Apr 15 19:01:31 on ttys013`
    *   `gauravghodge@Gauravs-MacBook-Air %`  (Indicates the user and host)
    *   A `curl` command is being executed:
        *   `-X POST "https://41d9-150-107-43-113.ngrok-free.app/api/"`  This sends a POST request to the ngrok URL.
        *   `-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"`: Specifies the content type.
        *   `-F question="How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-06 to 2008-01-29?"`:  Sends a "question" parameter with a specific question.
    *   `{"answer":"1121"}`: This is the JSON response received from the API call.  The answer to the question appears to be "1121".
    *    `gauravghodge@Gauravs-MacBook-Air %`

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image captures a developer working on a project (TDS-PROJECT-2.2) using VS Code and a terminal. The project likely involves an API that answers questions, possibly related to date calculations. The developer has sent a query asking about the number of Wednesdays between two dates and received the answer "1121" from the API. The ngrok setup indicates they're likely testing a locally developed API endpoint accessible via the internet.

Hi sir @carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @s.anand

I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into:

**Server is running and reachable.**  
 **GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code**, both return **200 OK**.  
 **Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people** – all received correct results.  
 **No issues seen in logs or deployment** – everything was set up properly.  
 **Others in my group got full marks** – we worked on the same project.

**I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.**  
 **I’ve spent weeks working on this project**, including sleepless nights.  
 **This is my last term** – if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.

Please recheck my project thoroughly. Here are the important links for you to verify:

* **API Documentation:** FastAPI - Swagger UI
* **API Endpoint:** http://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api

I truly believe that my server is functioning as expected, and I just need a re-evaluation to confirm that.

I’ve put in a lot of effort into this, and I sincerely request that you review it again.

as you can see my vm is working fine here

**Interpretation**

The image shows someone using Postman to interact with an API. The API likely serves Swagger UI to display its documentation. The response body shows HTML code to render Swagger UI, which will then load the API definition from `/openapi.json`. The status code "200 OK" indicates that the request was successful.
 Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image shows the Postman application.
*   The request type is set to "GET".
*   The URL is "http://localhost:8000/api" and the endpoint is "shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs".
*   There are tabs for "Params", "Authorization", "Headers", "Body", "Pre-request Script", "Tests", and "Settings".
*   There's a section for Query Parameters with "Key" and "Value" fields.

**Response Section**

*   The response section is active.
*   The response format is set to "HTML" and formatted as "Pretty".
*   The HTTP status code is 200 OK.
*   The response time is 247 ms.
*   The response size is 1.11 KB.

**HTML Response**

*   The response body shows HTML code related to Swagger UI.

*   `<body>` tag:
    *   `<div id="swagger-ui">`
    *   `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@5/swagger-ui-bundle.js"></script>`
        *   Comment <!-- SwaggerUIBundle is now available on the page -->
        *   `<script>` tag
            *   declaring a const ui = SwaggerUIBundle which includes the following parameters in JSON format:
            *   url: '/openapi.json',
            *   dom_id: "#swagger-ui",
            *   layout": "BaseLayout"
 Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Context**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web browser, likely a tool for testing or debugging APIs.  The interface is showing a request made to a specific URL and the server's response.

**Key Text & Elements:**

*   **Title Bar:**
    *   "shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/docs#/default/process\_request\_api\_post" - This is the URL of the page being displayed, indicating it's part of documentation related to an API request.  The specific endpoint being documented is `/default/process_request_api_post`.

*   **curl Command Example:**
    *   A `curl` command is shown, which is a common command-line tool for making HTTP requests. The command contains the URL `https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api`.  It also specifies headers ( `-H`) such as `accept: application/json` and `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`.  Crucially, it uses `-F` to send a 'question' parameter: `"What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/"`. This is prompting the API to find a GitHub Pages URL.

*   **Request URL:**
    *   `https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com/api` - This is the actual URL being targeted by the API request.

*   **Server Response:**
    *   **Code: 200** - This indicates a successful HTTP request.
    *   **Response Body:**
        *   `{"answer": "https://shashikumarkohir.github.io/my-portfolio/"}` - The API returned a JSON response. The "answer" field contains a GitHub Pages URL: `https://shashikumarkohir.github.io/my-portfolio/`.

*   **Response Headers:**
    *   These provide additional information about the server's response. Key headers include:
        *   `access-control-allow-credentials: true`
        *   `access-control-allow-origin: https://shashitdsproject2.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com`
        *   `content-type: application/json`
        *   `date: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:39:00 GMT`
        *   `server: nginx/1.24.0 (Ubuntu)`

**Key Observations:**

*   **API Functionality:**  The API appears designed to take a question (specifically, "What is the GitHub Pages URL?") and return the corresponding GitHub Pages URL.
*   **Successful Request:** The server returned a 200 OK status, and the response body contains the GitHub Pages URL.
*   **Specific User:** The GitHub Pages URL in the response belongs to the user `shashikumarkohir`.

**Potential Questions the Image Could Answer:**

*   What is the URL of the API endpoint?
*   What headers are required for the API request?
*   What is the format of the API response?
*   What is the GitHub Pages URL for user shashikumarkohir?
*   What is the server software being used? (nginx)
*   Was the API request successful? (Yes, 200 OK)

Hi @carlton  
@Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj  
Sir the same issue occurred on my end as well. My endpoint is returning the correct output, as demonstrated by @SK76 . However, it has still been marked as 0.  
Could you please check whether the evaluation is still in progress or has been finalized? I would appreciate any update on the status.  
(54/57 questions working, tested with different values and parameters)  
Roll num : 21f3001076

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Appearance:**

*   The image is a logo or icon design.
*   It consists of a white, stylized shape on a solid green circle.

**Shape and Design:**

*   The white shape resembles a stylized "F" or a lightning bolt. It has a sharp, angular design.
*   The shape is contained within a solid green circle, which provides a contrasting background.

**Color:**

*   The colors used are a bright green and white.
*   The specific shade of green appears to be teal or a greenish-blue.

**Potential Interpretations:**

*   The "F" shape could stand for a company's initials or brand name.
*   The lightning bolt imagery could represent speed, energy, or power.
*   The simple, clean design gives it a modern and tech-oriented feel.

**Possible Use Cases:**

*   It could be used as a logo for a technology company, a startup, or a product related to energy, electricity, or speed.
*   It might also represent a service that is fast or efficient.

If you have specific questions about the image, feel free to ask.

@carlton @Jivraj I am making this post because I didn’t get reply to my post on the same matter.

Please check it out. My app can remain deployed only till April 18th. In the Cloud Run logs, I do see some multiple POST requests made today with 200 response but I’m not sure whether it was the TDS team doing a re-evaluation or someone else.

Also, are there any updates on this bug in project 1 in datagen.

Thanks.

Sir, Same here, you can access it via this link Assignment solver

I kindly request you to check immediately by this link as I also have made it as an web app for your ease.

(my friends: please don’t use the link, as the api token request will be over)

Please look after it, already I was marked as absent for project -1 and now for this project -2 as 0. I don’t know why?..I don’t know whether I could be able to pass this course even with lots of efforts..

I am also seeing a score of 0. This is after the course TA’s said that I had scored well on the project without revealing my score. But I am pretty sure they won’t classify 0/100 as a good score.

2 days back I got my TDS Project-2 Score and it is showing as absent although I submitted my TDS project 2 , also deployed the app successfully and also filled the g-form

Here’s my deployed application on-render link with the attached screenshot of my TDS Dashboard:

Project : https://tds-project2-21f3000591.onrender.com/

Screenshot 2025-04-16 125037429×678 27 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a student's grade report for a course titled "Tools in Data Science." It is likely from a learning management system or course website.  The report is divided into sections displaying course information, assignment scores, overall average, project scores, and eligibility for the end-term exam.

**Textual Content Breakdown:**

*   **Title:** "Tools in Data Science"
*   **Subtitle:** "NEW COURSE"
*   **Assignment Scores:**
    *   Week 1 Assignment - 92.50
    *   Week 2 Assignment - 90.00
    *   Week 3 Assignment - 0.00
    *   Week 4 Assignment - 100.00
    *   Week 5 Assignment - 100.00
    *   Week 6 Assignment - Absent
    *   Week 7 Assignment - Absent
*   **Average:** "Average Assignment for final Scoring - 96.00"
*   **Programming Quiz:** "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - 90.00"
*   **Course Project:**
    *   COURSE PROJECT - 5.00
    *   Course Project Score 2 - Absent
*   **Exam Eligibility:**
    *   "Allowed to take End Term Exam?"
    *   "Yes"
*   **Button:** "Go to Course page >"

**Visual Features:**

*   The top of the image has a dark burgundy background with a pattern of lighter burgundy dots, giving it a textured appearance.
*   The "Tools in Data Science" title is in white text.
*   The text on the report is typically in a dark, readable font, likely a sans-serif typeface.
*   The bottom right has a clickable button to go to the course page.
*   A colour difference indicates the title and scores, which is a burgundy red on top of a white background.

**Interpretation:**

The student received good grades on most of the weekly assignments, with an overall average of 96.00. The student missed assignments in weeks 6 and 7. The programming quiz score is also high (90.00). The student's score for the first course project is low (5.00), and the second project was not submitted (absent). Despite the low project scores and missed assignments, the student is allowed to take the end-term exam. The image suggests this is a screen from a student dashboard displaying course progress and results.

@carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj  
I got a mail saying project 2 endpoints will be tested again.  
It also says that those updated endpoints which were submitted in the google form will be tested. Since i had submitted ngrok endpoint, wont it be invalid now?  
And if i start ngrok server wont it give me new endpoint?

Although I have completed all the required tasks for Project 2, it is still showing me as absent. I kindly request you to look into this issue, sir.

Could someone clarify whether the endpoint should include /api when being evaluated? I submitted it without /api and I’m wondering if it will be automatically appended or if we must include it explicitly. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini

there is no automatic appending.  
We will test **exactly** what we sent in the email (if you got an email) which is **exactly** what you submitted .

need to include the /api in the end. without that your mark will be 0 , since it cannot be evaluated without an end point

You were not present in the form Anand gave us. It most likely because you submitted after the deadline (or made edits after the deadline, if the form he shared allowed edits).

If u restart ngrok it changes endpoint every time. Your old endpoint is non existent as far as i know.

Is the marks shown on dashboard out of 20 or 100? coz i can clearly see in the logs that my api has answered all questions correctly, and my dashboard shows score of 20 for project 2.

I also want to know the same thing. Our old ngrok endpoint is useless at this point.

I’m writing to clarify the status of my Project 2, which is currently marked as “Absent”. I would like to respectfully state that I **submitted the form before the deadline** — specifically on 31st March 2025 at 22:11 , and I have the response copy as proof.

I would also like to emphasize that:

No edits were made to the form after submission.  
I did not make any changes to the project or submission after the deadline.  
My Vercel API is still active and functioning as expected.

Here are the submitted links:

GitHub Repo: GitHub - itskaiffazal/tdsproject2: Tools in data science Project 2 - TDS Solver  
 API Endpoint: https://tdsproject2.vercel.app/api/

I kindly request you to review my submission and take the necessary steps to update the status.

Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of an email. The email appears to be from an educational or technical institution (likely related to software engineering, given the content).

**Text and Content Breakdown:**

*   **Email Header:**
    *   Sender: 22t1 se2002
    *   Recipient: "to me"
    *   Timestamp: 5:01 PM (1 hour ago)

*   **Email Body:**
    *   Salutation: "Dear Learner,"
    *   Main Message:
        *   The sender has decided to re-run P2 evaluations on the recipient's endpoint server because of a low score.
        *   The recipient is requested to turn on their server endpoint from 11:00 pm to 02:00 am TONIGHT. The evaluation will take place during this timeframe, starting at 11:00pm and ending at 2:00am.
        *   The evaluation will only test the endpoint submitted in the official forms.
        *   Endpoints submitted via discourse or email will NOT be tested.
        *   If an updated endpoint was submitted in the latest form, that endpoint will be tested. Otherwise, the previous endpoint will be used.
        *   The endpoint being tested is: `https://e95b-2405-201-e04b-d085-9cf5-4192-fe5a-309e.ngrok-free.app/ask`

**Objects/Features:**

*   Email interface elements (likely Gmail, based on the general layout).
*   Possible interaction icons (star, reply, more options) in the email header.

I sincerely apologize for not using my official email address — it was an honest oversight and not an attempt to bypass any rules. I’d be truly grateful if you could kindly consider evaluating my project based on the valid, timely submission and the active working links provided.

This situation is quite distressing for me, as it could result in a significant setback, potentially requiring me to repeat the entire course. I fully acknowledge that the mistake was mine — a small yet critical one — and I sincerely request that if there is even a slight possibility of evaluation, please consider it.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist with verification. Your understanding and support would genuinely mean a lot.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respected Carlton Sir,  
I thought in gform we need to submit the deployment url:

tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app

### TDS Solver

but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url:

https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/

Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL

Sir i also did the same mistake and am truly sorry for what i did but it is my dearest request if you can look into this matter as it is very essential that the project is evaluated.  
I am once again very sorry for the mistake

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini

Dear Sirs,

I apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.

I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.

For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.

I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.

I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overview:**

The image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository page. It appears to be the main page, showing the file structure, recent commits, and repository information.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Repository Name:** "tds\_proj2f" and it has a "Public" label.
*   **Branch Information:** The active branch is "main" and there is 1 Branch and 0 Tags.
*   **Search Bar:** There's a search bar labeled "Go to file."
*   **Actions:** Buttons "Add file" and "<> Code"
*   **Recent Commit:** The latest commit shows a commit hash "21f2000304" with the message "final commit". It includes a green checkmark. The commit hash for this commit is "2e818b2" and happened "2 weeks ago". There is also "1 Commit" indicating this commit created 1 commit.
*   **File Listing:** The core of the image shows a list of files and directories in the repository. Each entry includes the file name and a description of the last commit that modified it. The files and directories listed include:
    *   `.env`
    *   `.gitignore`
    *   `GA1.html`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `README.md`
    *   `download.png`
    *   `ga1.py`
    *   `ga2.py`
    *   `ga2_6.py`
    *   `ga2_9.py`
*   **Commit Message and Age:** The commit message for each file is uniformly "final commit", and the "age" is "2 weeks ago."
*   **Top-Right Corner:** Has "Unpin" and "Unwatch 1"

**Interpretation:**

This image shows the state of a GitHub repository named "tds\_proj2f" two weeks after the "final commit". The repository seems to contain a mix of file types, including configuration files (`.env`, `.gitignore`), an HTML file (`GA1.html`), a license file (`LICENSE`), a readme file (`README.md`), an image (`download.png`), and several Python files (`.py`). It's likely the repository contains the source code for a project.

@Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @carlton  
Respected Sir,  
Sir I made a mistake while submitting the GFORM in hurry, I submitted the deployment URL instead of API URL:  
currently for re-evaluation my URL that I received on my mail id is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/`

but for API testing we need to add /api/ to the URL so final URL is:

`https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/`

I’m sorry for this mistake sir, please accept this small change, we just need to add /api/ to the URL

Thank you

actually 2 of my friend had submitted similar url with no /api/ but he got 80 marks and I also submitted without /api/ url but I got 0 so for re evaluation sir please add /api/ to the original URL as mentioned Above Please Sir

Thank you

@carlton I appreciate your response. I didn’t include “/api” at the end. Could you confirm if I’m allowed to update the form now before tonight’s evaluation? Thanks in advance.

I would like to clarify that I had submitted the form before the deadline. However, I believe I might have submitted it once again after the deadline, just to ensure that my project was submitted correctly.  
Please find attached the screenshot of my submission made before the deadline. Also, I haven’t received any response sheet for the form submitted after the deadline.

Thank you!

hello sir,  
the link have submitted has a UI interface for solving the question which looks somewhat like this  

image1126×936 61.3 KB

in order to access the endpoint we just need to add “/api” on the end however in the form I have submitted the link without the end line.  
Please Consider,  
Thanks & Regards,
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a form or interface for a "TDS GA Solver". The form appears to be designed for users to ask questions and potentially upload files for analysis or solving.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Title**: At the top, the text "TDS GA Solver" is prominently displayed, indicating the purpose of the form.

*   **"Ask a GA Question:"**: This label introduces a text input field, prompting users to type their question. The text box below the label contains the placeholder text "Type your question here...".

*   **"Upload File (Optional):"**: This label indicates that users can upload a file, but it's not required. There's a "Choose File" button and the text "No file chosen" next to it, which suggests that no file has been selected.

*   **"Submit" Button**: A large, gradient blue button labeled "Submit" suggests that this button is used to send the user's question and any uploaded files to the server.

*   **"Response:"**: There is a label "Response:" indicating that this will be the area for the response to the request that was submitted.

Overall, the image presents a simple form for users to interact with the "TDS GA Solver" system. It allows them to input a question, optionally upload a file, and submit the information for processing.

So anyone with an ngrok endpoint can send their new ngrok to us, but obviously you will need to start the server up much sooner than 11 in that case. An email will be sent to you specifically. DO NOT give us the endpoint on discourse. Reply to the email we will send specifically for you.

Since we will be evaluating between 11 to am you can run application on local machine and provide us with the ngrok url by 10:30 pm.

Send us the correct endpoint test it before sending us.

@Jivraj  
Dear Sir,

I’m sorry to bother you again, but I’m in a desperate situation and have no other option but to reach out through this channel.

As I mentioned in my previous message, my score has been marked as “absent,” even though I submitted my project well before the deadline. Additionally, I have not received any communication regarding a re-evaluation.

I kindly request you to look into this matter and provide a response at the earliest.

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/613](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/613)

\***Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint**

Dear @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini @carlton

I hope you’re doing well!

I’m currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at:

```
https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/

```

However, I’m encountering the following error:

```
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app

```

After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using **public DNS services** like **Google (8.8.8.8)** or **Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)**. This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).

---

### Suggested Fix:

To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a **public DNS** provider?

Recommended options:

* **Google DNS**: `8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`
* **Cloudflare DNS**: `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`

This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration.

---

### Alternate Option:

If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the **previously deployed endpoint** instead:

```
https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/

```

Please note that this endpoint may take **50 to 60 seconds** to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.

Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results.

---

Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!

Best regards,  
**Sahil Raj**
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a crossed hammer and wrench, likely used as a symbol for tools, construction, or repair.

*   **Objects:**
    *   **Hammer:** The hammer is depicted with a light blue head and a brown wooden handle. The head has a visible striking face and a claw at the back.
    *   **Wrench:** The wrench, also light blue, is open-ended.
*   **Arrangement:** The hammer and wrench are crossed, indicating a collaboration or a set of tools.
*   **Style:** The image has a pixelated style, reminiscent of older video game graphics or low-resolution icons.
*   **Color:** The image uses a limited color palette, primarily light blue and brown, against a black background.

**Possible interpretations:**

The image is a common representation for:

*   **Construction:** Signifying building, carpentry, or general construction work.
*   **Repair:** Indicating fixing, maintenance, or mechanical repairs.
*   **Tools:** Serving as a general symbol for tools or a toolbox.
*   **Settings/Configuration:** As an icon for settings or configuration menus (commonly used in software or websites).
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Appearance:**

*   The image is a small square graphic, resembling a digital icon or emoji.
*   It has a glossy, slightly 3D appearance, as if made of a polished material.
*   The background color is a bright orange.

**Central Feature:**

*   Two white arrows are intertwined. One is pointing to the right and the other to the left.
*   The arrows are curved and appear to be forming a circular or cyclical pattern.
*   The overall impression is that of a continuous loop or🔄 "sync" symbol.

**Potential Meanings:**

*   The icon could represent actions like:
    *   Synchronization (of data or files).
    *   Refresh or Reload (of a webpage).
    *   Iteration or Repetition (in a process).
    *   Data exchange or transfer.
    *   Reversal, such as an undo or redo operation.

**Overall:**

The image is a visually simple icon with a clear and recognizable symbol for synchronization or a similar concept related to cyclical processes.

Dear @Jivraj @carlton

In the google form which we submitted I had pasted the API endpoint as the one which I got in the vercel dashboard i.e. https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/  
whereas the correct api for giving post requests has **/api** added to the above which i forgot to add. i.e\*\*.https://tds-project2-rho.vercel.app/api/\*\*  
I have checked again and the post requests are working.  
I know that I made a mistake in the form and regret the same. If possible, please evaluate my project 2 with the above endpoint

Greetings, @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to kindly request the addition of an API to the link I previously submitted for Project 2. I realized that including this API is essential for the complete functionality and demonstration of the project.

please use this api url -: https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/api/  
instead of this - https://rahulbot-a369.onrender.com/

Thank you for your time and support. Looking forward to your response.

Hi Jivraj,

I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.

At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.

I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.

Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address.

Thank you!

Here's a breakdown of the image content based on the OCR and visual elements:

**Overall:**

The image shows a screen capture of a Windows PowerShell console. It's displaying output from a program, likely a Python script related to "data science tool." The output includes log messages, status codes, and file paths.

**Key Text & Features:**

*   **Console Window:** The title bar shows "system32\\cmd.e" and "Windows PowerShell."
*   **File Paths:** The output mentions several file paths that suggest a project structure:
    *   `E://data science tool//GA1//eighteenth.py`
    *   `E://data science tool//GA3//second.py`
    *   `E://data science tool//GA2//third.py`
    *   `E://data science tool//GA4//sixth.py`
*   **Log Messages:** There are several log messages with timestamps and associated information:
    *   `103.158.43.22:0 - "POST /api/ HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` (HTTP status)
    *   `tds_app - INFO - Logged IP 103.158.43.22 accessing /api/` (IP address logging)
    *   `GitHub Pages query → GA2/third.py`
*   **Scores & Confidence:** Some lines contain "score" and "confidence" values, likely from a machine learning model:
    *   `second.py (score: 0.41, confidence: 40%)`
    *   `third.py (score: 0.50, confidence: 50%)`
*   **Question/Solution Pairings:** The text patterns like "ing question with file" and "lution for" indicate that the program is likely trying to answer a question based on a file.
*   **Input Keywords:** The words "openai," "github," and "excel" appear after "in:", possibly representing user inputs.

**Inferred Meaning:**

Based on the content, we can infer that the Python program is likely doing the following:

1.  Taking a question or input (like "openai," "github," "excel").
2.  Analyzing files in a structured project (`E://data science tool/...`).
3.  Logging API access from a specific IP address (`103.158.43.22`).
4.  Calculating scores and confidence levels for its solutions.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any specific aspect.

Ok. Because our gform of 10th April has old ngrok endpoint which isnt valid now. Only the one which we have emailed to @Jivraj before 10:30 PM is current active. So i conclude our emailed ngrok endpoints of today to @Jivraj are enough.

You did not provide the right endpoint. Did you fill the form with the right endpoint.

Do you have proof that you have submitted before deadline? Because the gfrom shows the timestamp of being after deadline

Sir, I had submitted the project on 31st March at 11:30 PM itself. However, I made a change to the Vercel endpoint and updated it on 1st April. I can provide a screenshot of the Vercel deployment as proof. Unfortunately, I didn’t keep a copy of the Google Form submission. But to be honest, I shared the deployed project with some of my friends on 1st and 2nd April, after my edit, and they submitted it through the form after me. They received marks, but I haven’t received the same.

Hi @afsalshah

You submitted google form with wrong email address.  
This was the email address you used for filling form.

Sorry, Sir. I just realized the reason why my submission was not considered — I had used the email ID I created specifically for my MAD2 project. It was a genuine mistake on my part. However, I noticed in a previous thread that another student who submitted using a different email ID was given a chance to update it. I kindly request you to consider giving me the same opportunity as well.  
I have given my endpoint to the gform circulated in this thread.

We didn’t account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint.

Anyone who didn’t use their IITM email during submission—even if they later filled out the form—was filtered out and not considered for reevaluation.

Hi @carlton @Saransh\_Saini I believe it is a bit late now, but my Programming Quiz score is being displayed as Absent, I remember very well that I got a 4 out of 10, but it has been displaying Absent for a very long time now. This the ROE exam I am talking about here. Kindly fix this issue too.
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

The image displays text related to academic assessments, likely from a gradebook or similar system.

*   **First line:** "PROGRAMMING\_QUIZ\_1 - Absent"
    This indicates that the student was absent for the first programming quiz.
*   **Second line:** "COURSE PROJECT - 35.00"
    This suggests the student scored 35.00 on a course project.
*   **Third line:** "Course Project Score 2 - 0.00"
    This implies a second course project score of 0.00.

The background appears to be a light gray or off-white color. The text is dark and easily readable against the background. The overall layout suggests a list or summary of grades/assessments.

Hi Team,

Yesterday, I received a mail stating that our **Project 2** would be **reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight**, and that the following endpoint would be used to test the API:

https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/

However, I have not seen any logs in Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as **0**.

Could you please confirm if my URL was actually reevaluated?

Thank you!  
@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand @Saransh\_Saini

Dear Sir

Yesterday I received the mail to start my server from 11 pm to 2 am, but I am very sorry that I did not read the mail on time and hence could not start the server on time. I request you kindly to give a second chance for re evaluation. I have done the project and it would not be fair if it is not evaluated.

Thank you

**Subject:** Clarification Regarding Project 2 Reevaluation

Hi Team,

I received an email yesterday stating that our Project 2 would be reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight.  
However, I haven’t seen any deployment logs on Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as 0.

My url is working perfectly still there is no logs in the railway.

Could you please confirm whether my Project 2 was actually reevaluated?

Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of what appears to be a Google Form displayed on a mobile phone. The form is dark-themed, which is a common feature in many apps and operating systems. The screenshot is taken from an email client, judging by the presence of email icons at the bottom.

**Content of the Form:**

The form contains two key questions:

1.  **"What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 2?"**: This question is marked with an asterisk (\*), indicating that it is a required field. The question also provides an example format: "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name". The provided answer is "https://github.com/kartikayy1/project2final".
2.  **"What is the link to your API endpoint?"**: Similarly, this question is also marked as required. The description emphasizes the importance of providing an accurate URL that accepts POST requests. The provided answer is "https://project2final-beta.vercel.app/".

**Additional Text and UI Elements:**

*   At the bottom of the form, there's text that reads "Create your own Google Form" and a question "Does this form look suspicious? Report".
*   The bottom of the screenshot shows the UI of a mobile email application. We see icons for audio recording, replying, forwarding, and accessing emojis. There is also a notification indicating a large number of unread emails (99+).
*   The top of the screen displays the time "18:59" and the standard mobile status bar elements (signal strength, battery, etc.).

**Interpretation:**

The image displays a form that is requesting links to a GitHub repository and an API endpoint, presumably for a project named "Project 2". The context suggests that the person who took the screenshot is filling out this form.

Screenshot\_2025-04-17-13-16-34-275\_com.google.android.gm1080×2340 230 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image is a screenshot of what appears to be a Google Form displayed on a mobile phone.

**Text:**

*   **Header:** There is a header at the top left corner displaying the time "1:16 PM" and data usage information "0.1KB/s" with network indicators.
*   **Introductory Text:** It is a message explaining the purpose of the form.
    *   "To streamline the process of URL endpoints changes and accommodate your grievances we have created this form for you to be able to update your endpoints."
    *   "Your email (23f1002643@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) was recorded when you submitted this form."
*   **Question Prompt:** The main section asks for an updated endpoint.
    *   "Please provide your updated endpoint."
*   **Instructions:** Instructions emphasize the importance of editing the existing form and avoiding multiple submissions.
    *   "If the endpoint changes, please edit this form that you have already submitted so that we can have the latest endpoint. Do not submit multiple forms."
*   **Answer Field:** A field is provided with the URL "tds-ga-lim.vercel.app/api" pre-filled as an answer. This field is marked with an asterisk, indicating it is a required field.
*   **Google Form Footer:** At the bottom, it indicates the form was created using Google Forms.
    *   "Create your own Google Form"
    *   "Does this form look suspicious? Report"

**Objects and Features:**

*   **Mobile Phone UI:** The top and bottom sections of the screenshot show elements of the mobile phone's user interface.
*   **Navigation Buttons:** At the very bottom of the screenshot, the standard Android navigation buttons are visible.
*   **Mail Icon:** A mail icon is displayed at the lower left corner.
*   **Chat Icon:** A chat icon with a notification badge indicating "10" unread messages.
*   **Video Call Icon:** A video call icon.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of a Google Form requesting the user to provide an updated endpoint. The instructions emphasize editing a previous form rather than submitting multiple times. The email address listed may provide additional context, perhaps indicating the form's sender. The presence of the question, "Does this form look suspicious? Report," suggests that the creators are concerned about potential phishing or misuse of the form.

Yes, the new page took about 5–10 seconds to go live after the GitHub repository was created when we used Gmail as a parameter.  
If the Gmail is fixed, we can hardcode it in advance.  
In our case, Gmail is a parameter, so the function should remain dynamic and it would take 5-10 second to go live after we received answer.

sir my project 2 is also showing 0 but it was working. pls check if it was not working at least give some marks for the effort that w have put. I also accept that we have learnt a lot in this course and marks doesnot matter. but after putting a lot of effort day and night getting a zero, gives a drastic discouragement to even look at the laptop. pls consider if possible.

I have completed and submitted the assigned project 2, and I have verified that it is working correctly as per the given instructions.

However, I noticed that the score awarded to me for the project is 0. I believe this may be an error, as my project meets the required criteria and functions as expected.

I kindly request you to review my submission and let me know if there was any issue during evaluation or submission that may have led to this result.

I have deployed the project on vercel as instructed.  
I have uploaded all the links in google form and submitted it.

To support this, I am attaching a screenshot of the PowerShell window that shows an example of my application running successfully for one of the questions.  

ss1525×535 24.1 KB
The image displays a PowerShell terminal session where a user named "anshu" is interacting with an API using the `http` command-line tool. The user sends a POST request to the URL "https://tds-solver-lyart.vercel.app/api/" with a "question" parameter. The question is a Google Sheets formula: "=SUM(ARRAY_CONSTRAIN(SEQUENCE(100, 100, 15, 7), 1, 10))".  A comment explains that this formula won't work in Excel.  The user then asks, "What is the result?".

The terminal then shows the HTTP response received. It's an HTTP/1.1 200 OK response, indicating success.  Important headers include:

*   Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate
*   Content-Length: 33
*   Content-Type: application/json
*   Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:23:01 GMT
*   Server: Vercel

The Strict-Transport-Security header suggests that the site should only be accessed via HTTPS in the future. "X-Vercel-Cache: MISS" means that the response was not served from a cache. The X-Vercel-ID is also included.

The JSON response body contains two fields: "answer" with a value of 465, and "status" with a value of "success". This indicates that the API successfully processed the Google Sheets formula and returned the result.

@carlton @Jivraj I appreciate the team incorporating my updated response at the endpoint with the “/api” path and re-evaluating accordingly, as well as sharing the results via email.

To my surprise, when I invoke the same endpoint that was evaluated — using the correct multipart/form-data payload with both question and file fields — I consistently receive a 200 OK response with the expected output.

Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I’d like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?

For reference, I’ve attached a screenshot demonstrating the response.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

The image shows what appears to be a JSON-formatted data structure. It's an array (`[]`) containing a series of JSON objects (`{}`).  Each object represents a test result, possibly from an API testing process.

**Content of Each Object:**

Each JSON object has the following key-value pairs:

*   **"api"**: This key contains the URL of the API being tested. It's consistently "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/".
*   **"test\_code"**: This likely represents a unique identifier for the test case being executed. Examples include "GA1\_q18", "GA4\_q6", "GA2\_q3", "GA3\_q2", and "GA5\_q7".
*   **"status"**: This indicates the outcome of the test. In all cases shown, the value is "FAILED".
*   **"error"**: This provides details about the error encountered during the test.  It's a string that begins with "HTTP 400:", followed by a nested JSON object. The nested object contains a single key, `"error"`, with the value `"Missing question or file"`.

**Observations:**

*   All tests in the displayed data have failed.
*   The error message is consistent across all failures:  A "Missing question or file" error with an HTTP 400 status code. This suggests the API requires either a question or a file to be submitted, and this requirement was not met during these tests.
*   The test codes are different for each object.
*   The JSON structure appears to have issues with extra curly braces before each object.

**In summary, the image shows a set of failed API test results, indicating that the requests made to the API were missing required information (either a question or a file).**
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout and Context:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web-based API testing tool (likely Postman or a similar application). It shows a request being constructed and the subsequent response received. The interface is divided into sections for setting request parameters, headers, body, and scripts. The bottom section displays the server's response.

**Request Details:**

*   **Method and Endpoint:** The request is a `POST` request sent to the endpoint `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`.
*   **Body:** The request body is of type `form-data`.
    *   There are two parameters:
        *   `question`: The checkbox next to `question` is unchecked indicating that it is not included in the request. The value for the `question` key is "What is the value in the 'answer' column of the...".
        *   `file`: The checkbox next to `file` is checked meaning that it is included in the request. The value is `abcd.zip`, a file being uploaded.

**Response Details:**

*   **Status Code:** The response has a `400 Bad Request` status code. This indicates that the server considers the request to be malformed or incomplete.
*   **Response Body:** The response body is a JSON object:
    ```json
    {
        "error": "Missing question or file"
    }
    ```
    This message explicitly states that either the `question` or the `file` parameter is missing from the request, from the perspective of the server.  However, we can see the the `file` parameter is indeed present, implying that the `question` parameter is missing.

**Annotations/Text Overlays:**

*   "Sending request without Question": This annotation highlights that the request is being sent with the `question` parameter likely being omitted, which seems to be the cause of the error, as `file` is selected and passed.
*   "Response same as evaluvation": This annotation indicates that the response seen in this tool is the same as what was expected or encountered during an evaluation/testing phase.

**In summary, the image illustrates an attempt to send a POST request to an API endpoint with form data. A file is included, but the "question" is deliberately unchecked (omitted), resulting in a 400 Bad Request error with a JSON response that says either "Missing question or file" are missing.**
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a screen capture of a Postman request, a tool commonly used for testing APIs. The request is a POST request to the URL "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/".

Here are the key features and text present in the image:

*   **URL:** "https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/" (This is the endpoint the request is being sent to).
*   **Request Type:** POST
*   **Body Tab:** Selected and set to "form-data" for sending data.
*   **Form Data:**
    *   **Key:** "question", **Value:** "What is the value in the "answer" column of the..." (This field is enabled).
    *   **Key:** "file", **Value:** "abcd.zip" (The checkbox beside this is disabled indicating that no file will be sent). A yellow triangle to the left of the file name seems to indicate a warning.
*   **Response:**
    *   **Status Code:** "400 Bad Request"
    *   **Response Body:**
        ```json
        {
            "error": "Missing question or file"
        }
        ```

**Annotations/Text Overlays:**

*   "Sending req without file" - An arrow points from this text to the unchecked checkbox for the 'file' parameter in the form data.
*   "response same as evaluvation report" - An arrow points from this text to the response body displayed in JSON format.

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a scenario where a POST request is being sent to an API endpoint using Postman. The request is configured to send form data, including a "question" and a "file". However, the file is not being sent because the checkbox next to "file" in the form data is not checked. The server responds with a "400 Bad Request" error, indicating that the either a question or a file is missing. Based on the configuration, it seems likely that the "file" is the reason for the error.
 Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Overall Layout**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a tool used for making API requests, likely Postman or a similar application. It's set up to send a POST request to a specific endpoint.

**Key Sections & Fields**

*   **API Endpoint:**  `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/` This is the URL the request is being sent to.

*   **Request Type:** POST is selected.

*   **Form-Data Body:** The request body is structured as `form-data`. This allows sending both text and files.
    *   **Key: `question`**, **Value: `What is the value in the "answer" column of the...`**, **Type: `Text`** - This is the text of the question being sent in the request.
    *   **Key: `file`**, **Value: `abcd.zip`**, **Type: `File`** -  A file named "abcd.zip" is being sent along with the request.

*   **Expected Response:**
    *   **Response Code:** `200 OK` indicating that the request was successful.
    *   **Response Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "answer": "1234567890"
        }
        ```
        This is the JSON response received from the API, containing a single key-value pair where the key is "answer" and the value is "1234567890".

**Annotations**

There are annotations on the image showing:

*   Indication that request contained both file and question
*   Indication that the expected result code is 200 OK
*   Indication that the expected response is {"answer": "1234567890"}

**In Summary**

The image shows a successful API request to a hypothetical service where a question and a file are sent. The API returns a JSON response containing the value of the "answer". The request was sent using form-data.

> I would like to highlight an issue regarding the evaluation of the TDS Solver Project 2.

> As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle **POST** requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data.

> Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle **GET** requests.

> However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to **405 Method Not Allowed** errors.

> These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines.

The image contains a snippet of JSON data. It appears to represent the results of some tests or API calls. Here's a breakdown of the data:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The outermost element is an array (`[]`).
*   The array contains two objects (`{}`) representing two distinct tests.

**Structure of Each Object:**

Each object has the following key-value pairs:

*   `"api"`: The URL of the API endpoint being tested. In both cases, it's "https://tds-solver-bml0qi7k5-adityas-projects-07f86c8b.vercel.app/".
*   `"test_code"`: A string representing the identifier of the test. The values are "GA1\_q18" and "GA4\_q6" for the two tests, respectively.
*   `"status"`: Indicates the outcome of the test. Both tests have the status "FAILED".
*   `"error"`: Contains an error message. The error message is in HTML format and indicates an "HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed" error.  The message explains that the method used for the request is not allowed for the given URL.

**In Summary:**

The image shows the results of two failed API tests. Both tests targeted the same API endpoint but had different test codes ("GA1\_q18" and "GA4\_q6"). The failure reason for both is an "HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed" error, suggesting that the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used in the request is not supported by the API endpoint for these specific tests.

If there are any additional scenarios you’d like me to test, feel free to let me know, I’d be happy to help validate that the endpoint is functioning as expected. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a web application interface, likely a tool for making API requests (like Postman or Insomnia).
*   It is structured with a request definition area on the top and a response section at the bottom.

**Request Definition Area:**

*   **HTTP Method and URL:** A "POST" method is selected for the request, and the target URL is `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`.
*   **Tabs:** There are tabs for configuring different parts of the request: "Params," "Authorization," "Headers (9)," "Body," "Scripts," and "Settings." The "Body" tab is currently active (highlighted).
*   **Body Type:** Under the "Body" tab, "form-data" is selected. This indicates that the request body is being sent as form data, where data is encoded as a set of key-value pairs.
*   **Form Data Table:** A table presents the form data:
    *   **Key:** The left column holds the keys of the data. There are two entries: "question" and "file." Both are checked which is most likely enabling them.
    *   **Value:** The right column holds the values associated with the keys:
        *   "question": The value is "What is the value in the 'answer' column of the..." (the full question is truncated, but it seems like a specific query).
        *   "file":  A file named "q-move-rename-files.zip" is selected. There is an upload icon next to the file name which would suggest this file has been uploaded.
    *   **Description:** There are descriptions for the entries on the request. The description for the "file" field notes that the zip file was changed to one that does not contain any CSV file.

**Response Area:**

*   **Status Code:** The response status code is "400 Bad Request." This signifies that the server understood the request but was unable to process it due to an issue with the request itself.
*   **Response Body:** The response body is in JSON format:

    ```json
    {
      "error": "No CSV file found in zip."
    }
    ```

**Annotations:**

*   There are annotations pointing to the "q-move-rename-files.zip" file and the JSON response. The annotations highlight that the selected ZIP file does not contain a CSV file, leading to the expected "No CSV file found in zip." error response.

**Overall Impression:**

The image depicts a scenario where an API request is intentionally crafted to fail. The user is sending a request that requires a CSV file within a ZIP archive. However, the ZIP file provided does not contain a CSV, so the server correctly returns a 400 Bad Request error. The annotations emphasize the expected error response.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a web application interface, likely a tool for testing APIs. It showcases an HTTP POST request being configured and executed.

**Header Area:**

*   **URL:** The target URL for the POST request is visible: `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`
*   **Method:** The HTTP method is set to POST.
*   **Navigation Tabs:** Tabs are present for configuring different aspects of the request: "Params," "Authorization," "Headers (9)," "Body," "Scripts," and "Settings." The "Body" tab is currently selected.
*   **Action Buttons:** Buttons for "Save" and "Share" are located at the top right. A "Send" button is also prominent, used to execute the API request.

**Request Body:**

*   **Body Type:** The body type is set to "form-data." Radio buttons indicate options like "none," "x-www-form-urlencoded," "raw," "binary," and "GraphQL."
*   **Key-Value Pairs:** The body contains two key-value pairs:
    *   **Key:** "question," **Value:** "What is the value in the "answer" column of the..." (Data type: Text)
    *   **Key:** "file," **Value:** "abcd.zip" (Data type: File). There's a warning icon next to "abcd.zip," which might indicate a potential issue with the file. There is also a cloud upload icon, enabling users to upload files.

**Response Area:**

*   **Tabs:** Tabs are available for viewing the "Body," "Cookies," "Headers (10)," and "Test Results."
*   **Response Body:** The "Body" tab is selected, and the response is displayed in JSON format:
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "3812934199"
    }
    ```

**Annotations (Red Text with Arrows):**

*   **Arrow pointing to abcd.zip:** The text "Updated the zip with new csv file with diff value" indicates that the zip file "abcd.zip" was modified and now contains a CSV file with different data than before.
*   **Arrow pointing to the answer value:** The text "Got expected answer" signifies that the returned value in the response ("3812934199") matches the expected output after the file update.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image illustrates a scenario where an API request is being used to extract an "answer" value from a CSV file contained within a zipped archive. The zipped file was updated with a new CSV file containing a different answer. Upon sending the request with the updated zip file, the API returned the expected new answer value.
 Here is a detailed description of the image content:

The image is a screenshot of a Postman or similar API testing tool, demonstrating a POST request being made to the endpoint `https://fileqa-app.vercel.app/api/`. The request is formatted as `form-data`.

**Request Body:**

*   **Key:** `question`
    *   **Value:** `What is the value in the "answer" column of the...`
    *   Type: Text
*   **Key:** `file`
    *   **Value:** `def.zip`
    *   Type: File

The screenshot includes a note that `def.zip` contains a new CSV file with only column names and no data values.

**Response:**

The response body is a JSON object indicating an error:

```json
{
  "error": "Answer column not found or empty."
}
```

The image also indicates that the expected error message is `"Answer column not found or empty."`.

In summary, the screenshot demonstrates a scenario where an API endpoint receives a question and a zipped CSV file as input. The CSV file only contains column headers without data, leading to an expected error indicating that the "answer" column was not found or is empty.

the answer is correct expect for extra spaces it was told that those spaces are neglectable still it showed as error plz consider this @carlton
The image shows a JSON object. The object has the following keys:
- "api": This contains a URL: "https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/".
- "test_code": This has the value "GA1_q18".
- "status": This has the value "ERROR".
- "error": This contains an error message: "near \"```sql\nSELECT SUM(price* units) AS total_sales\nFROM tickets\nWHERE LOWER (type) = 'gold';\n```\": syntax error".

The error message indicates a syntax error in an SQL query. The SQL query attempts to calculate the total sales from a "tickets" table, where the ticket type is "gold". The error suggests a problem with the SQL syntax near the provided code block.

@Jivraj @carlton  
this was one of the question it asked on api  
‘’‘{

Case 3: JSON Key Count – XF Parameter (GA5\_q7)

{

“api”: “https://app.algsoch.tech/api/”,

“test\_code”: “GA5\_q7”,

“status”: “ERROR”,

“error”: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file. Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’”

}

#### What Was Expected:

The question required developing a script that:

* Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and
* Counts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure.

It was explicitly stated that:

* Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.
* The file to be used was:  
  E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json

#### What I Did:

I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.

Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command:

curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \

-H “accept: application/json” \

-F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \

-F “file=@E:\data science tool\GA5\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json”

API Output:{“answer”:“14602”}

This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.

#### What Went Wrong on API Side:

The API returned a parsing error, indicating:

“invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’”

However:

* My file was valid JSON, properly parsed.
* The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.
* It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.

#### Insight:

If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.

However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image features a digital illustration or icon of a piece of paper with a pencil superimposed on it. It's designed to represent writing or note-taking.

**Detailed Elements:**

*   **Paper:** A rectangular sheet of paper with a light blue border is visible. There are several horizontal lines that suggest text on the paper.
*   **Pencil:** A yellow pencil with a red eraser is diagonally positioned over the paper, as if in the act of writing. The pencil has a sharpened graphite tip.
*   **Background:** The image has a black background, which makes the paper and pencil stand out.

**Interpretation:**

The image likely represents concepts related to writing, education, documentation, or creativity. It could be used as an icon for a note-taking app, a writing software, or in any context where writing is involved.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a single graphic element: a **check mark** or **tick mark** symbol.

**Details:**

*   **Shape:** The check mark is white and stylized, with slightly rounded edges.
*   **Background:** The check mark is set against a square-shaped green background. The green appears to be a muted shade, perhaps leaning towards a lighter, less saturated green.
*   **Stylization:** The background square appears to have a slight glossy or reflective finish, giving it a somewhat three-dimensional and modern look.

**In summary:** It's a simple, clean representation of a check mark icon or emoji within a green square background.
 Certainly! Let's break down the image you provided.

**Content Description:**

The image displays a bright yellow triangular warning sign. In the center of the triangle is a bold black exclamation point (!). The sign appears to be digitally rendered, giving it a slightly glossy or plastic-like texture. The pixelated edges suggest the image is of a smaller resolution.

**Key Features:**

*   **Shape:** Triangle (specifically an equilateral triangle)
*   **Color:** Yellow background, black exclamation point.
*   **Symbol:** Exclamation point (!) indicating a warning or caution.
*   **Texture:** Appears glossy or slightly 3D.
*   **Resolution:** Appears to be low-resolution, given the pixelated edges.

**Possible Interpretations:**

This image typically represents a general warning or hazard. It's a common symbol used to alert people to potential dangers or important information that requires attention.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Object:** The image depicts a classic incandescent light bulb.

**Features:**

*   **Shape:** The light bulb has the typical pear-shaped glass bulb.
*   **Light:** The bulb is emitting a bright yellow light, suggesting it's turned on.
*   **Filament:** Inside the bulb, there's a visible filament composed of a coiled wire. This is the part of the bulb that glows when electricity passes through it, producing light.
*   **Base:** The base of the bulb is a light blue color and appears to be the screw-in type commonly found in household light fixtures.
*   **Color:** The overall color palette is simple, with yellow, light blue, and black.
*   **Pixelated Style:** The image has a pixelated or blocky appearance, possibly indicating a low resolution or that it was created using a pixel art style.
*   **Background:** The background is black, which makes the light bulb stand out prominently.

**Possible Interpretations:** The image could represent:

*   **An idea or inspiration:** Light bulbs are often used as symbols for bright ideas or moments of insight.
*   **Energy or electricity:** A lit light bulb is a clear representation of power and illumination.
*   **Innovation:** The iconic light bulb is often associated with inventions and new technologies.

image1491×166 5.46 KB

in this question even though the answer is correct except those extra spaces it has been showing error plz check into this @carlton @Jivraj
The image displays a JSON formatted data structure containing information about an API call and its result. The JSON object has the following key-value pairs:

- `"api"`: This key holds the URL of the API endpoint: `"https://roe-i6ghzat4g-manu-cs-projects.vercel.app/api/"`.
- `"test_code"`: This key holds a string value "GA1_q18".
- `"status"`: The status of the test is `"ERROR"`.
- `"error"`: This contains a detailed error message. It indicates a syntax error in a SQL query. The query itself is embedded within the error message and it attempts to select the sum of (price * units) as total_sales from a table named "tickets" where the lowercase of the "type" column equals "gold". The backticks are part of the error message.

Essentially, the image shows that an API call associated with a test code "GA1_q18" resulted in an error, specifically a SQL syntax error within the query.

@23f2002286 and everyone else,

At the end of the term operations has a lot of updates to push. We have sent the marks to them, but they have not yet pushed it to the dashboard. As soon as they push it, they will inform us and we will then send out a discrepancy form to all of you if you find any issues.

Thanks and Kind regards

I had completed project 2 but because of a mistake i filled the form with my personal mail id fue to which the project eas not evaluated i fully consider this to be my fault and assure that something like this will not happen in the future .

If my evaluation of project 2 is not done then i will fail the tds course and will have to repeat this course which will cause a financial strain on me

I know that it is difficult for you to consider this request but it is my humblest request if you can just look through the project i tried to complete the project with the best of my abilities

It will be really helpful if you can access the project  
My git repository link is - GitHub - kartikayy1/project2final

Good Afternoon Sir.  
This is regarding project 1 and project 2.

**Project-1 Evaluation**  
Sir, For the project 1, I have written the code, uploaded in GitHub and the dockerfile image is created and uploaded successfully.  
Sir, I already contacted regarding Project - 1, you said to check it by replicating the test environment. I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn’t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.

**Project-2 Evaluation**  
Regarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.

Sir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks.

In anticipation of quick response  
Thank You

Hi everyone,

I know that some of you might be feeling anxious about your scores etc. We are currently in the process of validating your scores on all the projects, roe, assignments, exam and bonus, so we will not be able to respond quickly to each individual post here for the time being.

Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them.

Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon.

Kind regards,

TDS Team

Dear Team,

this is proof that I have successfully submitted the form and the api is still working, why am i still marked as absent? Please respond my email is 23f1002942@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**
The image is a screenshot of a Gmail interface, specifically displaying an email related to "TDS Project 2 Endpoints." The email content seems to be a notification or an announcement regarding changes in URL endpoints for the project.

**Key Textual Elements:**

*   **Email Header:**
    *   "M Gmail" (Gmail logo and title)
    *   Search bar with "project 2" entered as the search term.
    *   "Active" (likely indicating the email filter in use).
    *   "IIT Madras A" (User/account identifier).
    *   "5 of many" (Suggests there are multiple emails related to the search term).
*   **Left Navigation Pane:**
    *   "Compose" button
    *   Menu options: "Mail," "Chat," "Meet"
    *   Email folders: "Inbox" (with a count of 4,645), "Starred," "Snoozed," "Sent," "Drafts," "Categories," "More"
    *   "Labels" with "proctor" listed.
*   **Email Content:**
    *   Title: "TDS Project 2 Endpoints"
    *   Salutation: "Dear Learner,"
    *   Body:  Explains that due to "major operational changes in the backend," there have been unforeseen delays, leading to a need to restart servers.  The email indicates that URLs might have changed and instructs recipients to update their endpoints using the provided form.
    *   Email address recorded: "(23f1002942@ds.study.iitm.ac.in)"

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
Why am my I getting `GET` request to my api endpoint? It must be IITM’s http request because I have not shared it with anyone.

image804×1035 206 KB

It clearly written in the project 2 in TDS portal that api must accept `POST` request, not `GET`.

image1065×440 42.5 KB

It is requested to kindly look into this matter and please clarify.
Here's a detailed description of the image's content, focusing on the text and its meaning:

**Overall Impression:**

The image presents a log or output, likely from a network monitoring tool or web server. It shows various HTTP requests and some warnings. The background is dark (probably a terminal or console window). The text is predominantly in a light, monospaced font.

**Key Elements and their Meanings:**

*   **INFO:** Denotes an informational log entry. This indicates a normal event or activity being recorded.
*   **WARNING:**  Signifies a potential issue or problem that might require attention.
*   **IP Address:Port:** (e.g., "123.160.223.72:54416")  This represents the client IP address and port from where the HTTP request originated.
*   **"GET /...":**  This is an HTTP GET request, the most common type of web request.
    *   "/" typically represents the root of a website.
    *   "/squid-internal-mgr/cachemgr.cgi": Suggests a request for a specific resource related to a Squid proxy server's internal management.
    *   "/login": Indicates a request for a login page.
    *   "/favicon.ico": A request for the website's small icon that appears in browser tabs and bookmarks.
    *   "http%3A//api.ipify.org/?format=json": Indicates a request to the ipify API to get the client's IP address. The '%3A' is a URL encoding for the ':' character.
*   **"PRI \* HTTP/2.0":** Suggests a request using the HTTP/2 protocol, possibly related to connection setup or negotiation.
*   **"CONNECT www.shadowserver.org%3A443":** An attempt to establish a connection to "www.shadowserver.org" over port 443 (HTTPS). Shadowserver.org is an organization that monitors and reports on internet security threats.
*   **HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2.0:** Specifies the HTTP protocol version used for the request.
*   **404 Not Found:**  An HTTP status code indicating that the requested resource was not found on the server.
*   **"Invalid HTTP request received.":**  This warning indicates that the server received a request that it couldn't understand or process correctly (potentially malformed or incomplete).

**Interpretation:**

The log indicates that various clients are making HTTP requests to the server. Most of these requests are resulting in "404 Not Found" errors, implying that the server isn't configured to handle those specific requests or that the resources are missing. There are also several "Invalid HTTP request received" warnings, which point to problems with the clients' requests themselves.

**Possible Scenarios:**

*   **Web Server Issues:** The server might be misconfigured, or some files/resources are missing.
*   **Network Scanning:** The logs may be a result of automated network scanning activity (bots or security tools probing the server).
*   **Malicious Activity:** The "Invalid HTTP request" warnings could be attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Proxy Server Problems:** If it's a proxy server's logs, there might be issues with how it's handling requests or the backend servers it's trying to reach.
*   **Misconfigured Client:** The clients making the requests may be misconfigured (requesting the wrong URLs).

In summary, the image captures network activity with a mix of standard HTTP requests, errors, and potential anomalies. It points to issues that need investigation to determine the root cause.
 Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows documentation-like text with a code snippet. It explains how to interact with an API endpoint.

**Text Content:**

1.  **Introductory Text:**
    *   "Your application exposes an API endpoint. Let's assume that it is at https://your-app.vercel.app/api/."
    *   "The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/ with the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data."
    *   "For example, here's how anyone can make a request:"

2.  **Code Snippet:**
    *   The code is presented in a "bash" context (as indicated by the "bash" label).
    *   The code is a `curl` command that sends a POST request to the API.

**Code Breakdown:**

*   `curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \`:  Specifies a POST request to the provided URL. The `\` indicates a line break for readability in the command.
*   `-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \`: Sets the Content-Type header for the request, indicating that the request will send data in multipart/form-data format.
*   `-F "question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is t"`: Sends a field named "question" with a text-based question as its value.
*   `-F "file=@abcd.zip"`:  Sends a file named "abcd.zip" as the value for the field "file". The `@` symbol is a curl convention for specifying a file to be uploaded.

I am also receiving the odd GET requests, however, I don’t believe these are being sent by the evaluation teams. Our endpoints are open to internet and there are bots everywhere which will send these kind of random requests to scan for potential exploit/hacking targets.

I too was getting these requests.

@carlton sir mentioned this in one of the posts:

Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread Tools in Data Science

> They are malicious probes. A global cyber war is going on. So anything that can be compromised is being probed.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a headshot of a man. He's facing the camera and appears to be smiling slightly. The background is a plain, light yellow color.

**Detailed Features:**

*   **Subject:** The man has short, dark hair and is wearing glasses with rectangular frames. He's wearing a purple button-down shirt.
*   **Facial Features:** He has a light skin tone and a pleasant, friendly expression. He's looking directly at the camera.
*   **Clothing:** The purple shirt is visible, and it appears to be a solid color.
*   **Background:** The background is a simple, uniform light yellow color, without any discernible patterns or objects.

Without further information or context, it's difficult to draw more specific conclusions from the image. However, these details would be useful for matching the image to a profile, identifying the person, or understanding the overall style and setting of the photograph.

Just recieved this on my mail. Happy that everything worked out pretty well w/o the need for hardcoding. I’m guessing GA1-q18 bugged out because of escape sequences in the codeblock  That’s LLMs for you!

Can’t expect 100% reliability, even at 0 temperature.

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image shows a snippet of JSON data displayed on a dark screen, likely from a mobile device or a code editor.  The filename at the top of the screen is "22f3001642.json".

**JSON Data Structure:**

The JSON data is structured as an array `[]` containing multiple objects `{}`.  Each object represents the results of a "test".

**Structure of Each Test Object:**

Each test object (with the exception of GA3_q2) generally has the following key-value pairs:

*   `"test_code"`: A string indicating the test identifier (e.g., "GA1\_q18", "GA2\_q3", "GA3\_q2", "GA4\_q6", "GA5\_q7").
*   `"status"`: A string indicating the test's outcome (e.g., "ERROR", "PASSED").

**Specific Details about each test:**

*   **`GA1_q18`:**  The test has a `"status"` of `"ERROR"`.  Crucially, it also includes an `"error"` key. The `"error"` value suggests a syntax error near a SQL query. The query itself attempts to calculate `total_sales` from a table named `tickets`, filtering by `type = 'gold'`. The error message "near \"```sql\nSELECT..." indicates there's an issue related to how the SQL query is formatted or interpreted, potentially involving the backticks or newline characters.

*   **`GA2_q3`:** The test has a `"status"` of `"PASSED"`.

*   **`GA3_q2`:** The test has a `"status"` of `"PASSED"`, but is missing this `status` entry within the curly braces.

*   **`GA4_q6`:** The test has a `"status"` of `"PASSED"`.

*   **`GA5_q7`:** The test has a `"status"` of `"PASSED"`.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The data represents the results of a series of tests.
*   At least one test (GA1\_q18) resulted in an error, specifically a syntax error in a SQL query. The error message provides some context about the problem.
*   The other tests (GA2\_q3, GA3\_q2, GA4\_q6, GA5\_q7) passed.
*   There is an anomaly in the record for `GA3_q2`. The `status` is not specified within the curly braces and is listed as a separate entity.

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a screenshot of a Python code file hosted on GitHub. The user interface indicates it's a view of the "Q23.py" file within the "GA2" directory of the "GASolver" repository, which belongs to the "TDS-Hackers" GitHub organization.

**GitHub Navigation & Metadata:**

*   **URL:** The URL bar shows the full path to the file: `https://github.com/TDS-Hackers/GASolver/blob/main/GA2/Q23.py`
*   **Repository Details:**  It displays the repository name "GASolver" under the organization "TDS-Hackers."
*   **Navigation:** Standard GitHub navigation elements are visible, including "Issues," "Pull requests," "Actions," "Projects," "Wiki," "Security," and "Insights."
*   **File Details:**  The filename is clearly stated as "Q23.py" within the "GA2" directory.
*   **Version Information:** The displayed version of the file is "23f2004837 Version 1."
*   **File Stats:** The file is 132 lines of code (LOC=105) and has a size of 4.37 KB.

**Code Content:**

The Python code snippet shows a function called `execute` taking `question` and `parameter` as input. Let's break down the code:

1.  **Imports:**
    *   `import os, json`
2.  **Function Definition:**
    *   `def execute(question: str, parameter: str):`
        *   This defines a function named `execute` that takes two string arguments: `question` and `parameter`.
    *   `#return gitPortfolio (parameter ["email"])`
        *   This is a commented-out line, suggesting an intention to call a function `gitPortfolio` using the "email" key from the `parameter` dictionary.
3.  **Cache:**
    *   `cache = { ... }`
        *   This defines a dictionary named `cache` which appears to store URLs associated with email addresses.
        *   **Key-Value Pairs:** The `cache` dictionary contains email addresses (presumably associated with some data source) as keys and corresponding GitHub profile/repository URLs as values. Some examples:
            *   `"23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://23f2004837.github.io/"`
            *   `"21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://digvijaysinhchudasamai"`
            *   `"24f2006749@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://sakshi6749.github.io/p"`
            *   `"22f3002188@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://22f3002188.github.io/p"`
            *   `"22f2001590@ds.study.iitm.ac.in": "https://22f2001590.github.io/T"`
4.  **Conditional Logic:**
    *   `if parameter ["email"] not in cache:`
        *   This checks if the value of the "email" key in the `parameter` dictionary is *not* found as a key within the `cache` dictionary.
    *   `return ("Enter the value in url_cache"}`
        *   If the email is *not* in the cache, the function returns a message indicating that the value needs to be entered in "url\_cache".
5.  **Cache Lookup and Return:**
    *   `return cache [parameter ["email"]]`
        *   If the email *is* found in the `cache` dictionary, the function returns the corresponding URL associated with that email address.

**Overall Interpretation:**

This code snippet seems to implement a simple caching mechanism for retrieving GitHub profile URLs based on email addresses. The `execute` function checks if an email address is present in a predefined cache. If it's in the cache, the corresponding URL is returned; otherwise, a message indicating the need to update the cache is returned. This suggests a system where user profile data is stored/retrieved, and the code aims to avoid repeated lookups by using a local cache.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Content:**
The image is a screenshot of a web browser displaying text content.

**Textual Elements:**

*   **Browser Address Bar:** The address bar at the top shows the URL: `https://23f2004837.github.io`
*   **Prominent Text:** The largest text on the screen is: `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.
*   **Repeated Text:** The email address `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is repeated in a smaller font below.
*   **Hyperlinked Text:** The email address `23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is again displayed in blue and underlined at the bottom, indicating it's a clickable hyperlink.

**Objects and Features:**

*   **Browser UI:** The standard browser UI elements are visible, including the back arrow, refresh icon, and the lock icon next to the URL in the address bar.

**In Summary:**

The image seems to display an email address (`23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) on a webpage hosted at a GitHub Pages site (`23f2004837.github.io`). The repetition of the email address, once as plain text and once as a hyperlink, suggests that the content is focused on this specific email. The `ds.study.iitm.ac.in` domain suggests that the email is related to a study program at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Context:**

The image shows a snippet of HTML code displayed within a web browser's developer tools (specifically, the "Elements" tab). This tab allows developers to inspect the structure and content of a webpage.

**HTML Structure:**

*   **`<html>`**: The root element of the HTML document.
*   **`<head>`**: Contains metadata about the HTML document (e.g., title, links to stylesheets, etc.). In the image, it is collapsed.
*   **`<body>`**: Contains the visible content of the webpage.  Here's what's inside the body:
    *   **`<h1>`**: A level 1 heading. The text content is the email address "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".
    *   **Text Node:**  After the `<h1>` tag, there's a plain text string: `" 23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in "`.  Notice the space before and after the email address.
    *   **`<p>`**: A paragraph element. Inside the paragraph:
        *   **`<a>`**: An anchor (link) element. This is used to create hyperlinks.
            *   `href="mailto:23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"`:  The `href` attribute specifies the URL the link points to. In this case, it's a `mailto:` link, which will open the user's default email client and pre-populate the "To:" field with the specified email address.
            *   The text content of the link is the same email address: "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".  This is the text the user would see and click on.

**Key Observations:**

*   The email address "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" is repeated multiple times in the HTML.
*   The email is present both as a heading and as a clickable link.
*   The presence of the `mailto:` link suggests that the email address is intended to be used for sending emails.
*   The `p` element has a `== $0` beside it, which may be due to it being selected.

In essence, this HTML code likely aims to display an email address and provide a convenient way for users to directly email it.
 Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout and Context**

The image shows a web browser interface, likely a programming environment or online coding challenge.  The top part displays a section of a web form asking for a GitHub Pages URL.  The bottom portion shows the "Sources" tab of a web developer tool (like Chrome DevTools or Firefox Developer Tools), displaying the source code of a JavaScript file named "exam.js".

**Web Form Section**

*   **Prompt:** "What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://\[USER].github.io/[REPO]/".  This indicates the user is being asked to provide a valid GitHub Pages URL.
*   **Input Field:** A text input field with the value "https://23f2004837.github.io/".  This is likely the user's attempt at the correct URL.
*   **Status:**  Below the input field, the text "Checking..." is displayed, indicating that the URL provided is being validated.
*   **Hint:** "If a recent change that's not reflected, add ?v=1, ?v=2 to the URL to bust the cache."  This provides a troubleshooting tip for potential caching issues.
*   A curved arrow icon, likely a refresh or submit button.

**Developer Tools - Sources Tab**

*   **File Explorer:** A file explorer on the left shows a list of files, including:
    *   `exam.sanand.workers.dev`
    *   `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2`
    *   `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2.info.js`
    *   `exam-tds-2025-01-ga2.js` (This file is currently open in the code editor).
*   **Code Editor:** The main area displays the content of the "exam.js" file.  Key parts of the JavaScript code visible include:
    *   `y = await $(f)`: Indicates an asynchronous operation possibly using `await` to get the result.
    *   `y = true`: A boolean assignment, potentially indicating a success or valid check.
    *   `$async a => {}`:  Likely a lambda function used with `async`
    *   `f = "https://23f2004837.github.io/"`: The attempted GitHub Pages URL is hardcoded as a string in the javascript source code.
    *   `catch (_)`: A try-catch block, indicating error handling.
    *   `R_ = R = "Incorrect. Try again."`:  Sets a variable (likely for feedback) to an error message.
    *   `d[e] = y ? r[e].weight : 0;`: A conditional assignment related to weights.

**Inferences and Observations**

*   The user's provided URL "https://23f2004837.github.io/" is likely being evaluated within the "exam.js" code.
*   The code checks if the URL exists or is accessible and uses the provided URL for validation.
*   If the check fails (the `catch` block is executed), the code sets an error message indicating the URL is "Incorrect".

In summary, the image portrays a user attempting a coding challenge (likely related to GitHub Pages), and their submitted URL is being validated by JavaScript code. The code checks the URL and provides feedback based on the outcome.
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a question and answer relating to GitHub Pages URLs.

**Question:**
"What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/"

This implies that the question is asking the user to identify or provide a valid GitHub Pages URL. The example format given helps guide the user by showing the structure of a typical GitHub Pages URL where `[USER]` is the GitHub username and `[REPO]` is the repository name (though the latter is optional for user pages).

**Answer:**
The text box contains: "https://23f2004837.github.io/"

**Feedback:**
Below the text box and slightly left-aligned, there is a label that says "Correct." This indicates that the URL provided in the text box is considered valid for the question. The text box is surrounded by a dark green outline.

I would like to bring to your attention that the project URL I submitted was accessible and working correctly in my browser, even without the “http” or “https” prefix. A friend of mine submitted a similar URL and received full marks. Furthermore, I have updated my URL using HTTPS via Google Forms, so I kindly request you to consider evaluating my project using the latest URL provided.

This is a humble request, as I am currently at risk of receiving a grade ‘E’, which will significantly impact my overall CGPA. As an alternative, I am also willing to retake the course in the next term and pay the fee again if needed.

In the P1, unfortunately scored zero due to a minor mistake and was not given an opportunity to correct it. I truly believe that in real-life scenarios, we are often given chances to rectify such errors, and I sincerely hope for the same consideration here.

**Subject:** Request to Share My Student-Built TDS Assistant Platform

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m **Vicky Kumar**, a student from the Data Science and Applications program at **IIT Madras**. Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called **“Vicky App”** — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like **TDS,**.

The system is capable of:

* Accurately solving over **90% of assignment-style questions** using regex and phonetic matching
* Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input
* Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON
* Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM

You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech

---

### What’s in it for students:

* They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically
* Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload
* I’ve made it **free for the first 3 questions**
* After that, students can access the full platform for just **₹199/month**, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs

---

### My Humble Request:

This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.

To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.

I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.

It’s built *by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students* — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.

Thank you so much for your time and support.

Warm regards,
