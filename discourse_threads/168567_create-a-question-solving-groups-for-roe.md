Whoever wants can participate and then we go into breakout rooms and each group solves a particular question and then we all share the code so we can complete the ROE faster and more effienctly?

Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think they will permit this.

Sharing answers is asking for help

If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work right?  
Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split the tasks efficiently and get it done.  
Thoughts?

this is valid. should we just ask them? Could u message a TA?
That's an image of a single uppercase letter "T". 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Letter:** A white, sans-serif capital "T" is centrally located.  The lines are clean and simple.

* **Background:** The background is a solid, medium-toned green.

* **Size and Style:** The "T" is relatively large compared to the background, filling a significant portion of the image. The font is simple and straightforward, not ornate or stylistic.

The overall impression is a simple, clean graphic featuring a single letter on a colored background.  It might be an avatar, a logo element, or part of a larger design.

That's a close-up headshot of a man. 


Here's a description:

* **The Man:** He appears to be middle-aged, with light to medium skin tone. His hair is short and somewhat graying, receding slightly at the temples. He's wearing glasses, and his expression is somewhat serious or pensive. The lighting is dramatic, with a strong light source seemingly coming from the upper left, creating shadows on the right side of his face and emphasizing the contours of his features. He appears to be wearing a dark-colored collared shirt or jacket.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is not very high; it's somewhat blurry and pixelated, suggesting it may be a low-resolution scan or a digital image that has been compressed significantly. The colors are somewhat muted and the overall tone is dark.

There is no text visible in the image.  The focus is entirely on the man's portrait.

Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing answers in a public forum.

That's the logo for Discord, a popular VoIP, instant messaging, and digital distribution platform. 


The image shows a simplified, stylized representation of a friendly face. Here's a breakdown:

* **Shape and Color:** The logo is a solid, round circle, predominantly a medium-toned purple or bluish-purple.

* **Central Figure:** Inside the circle is a white, simplified face-like shape. It's somewhat rounded rectangular, with rounded corners and a slightly curved bottom edge suggesting a happy mouth.  There are two small, simple circles representing eyes, also white.

* **Overall Style:** The style is minimalist, flat, and friendly. The lack of detail and the soft curves contribute to its approachable look. There is no text in this particular image; it's purely the iconic visual representation of the Discord brand.

That's an image of a single, uppercase letter "T". 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Letter:** The letter "T" is white and is in a sans-serif font, meaning it lacks the small decorative strokes found on the ends of letters in serif fonts.  It's relatively simple and clean in design.

* **Background:** The background is a solid, medium shade of green.

* **Overall:** The image is very simple; it's just the letter "T" centered on a green square background.  It likely represents an icon, initial, or a single character from a larger text element.

That's a close-up headshot of a man, appearing to be middle-aged, with light to medium skin tone. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Man:** He has short, slightly unkempt, dark-brown or graying hair that is somewhat messy. His face is partially in shadow, making some details less clear. He appears to be wearing glasses, though the frames are not very distinct. His expression is somewhat pensive or neutral. He's wearing a dark-colored, possibly brown or gray, collared shirt.

* **Lighting and Background:** The lighting is dramatic, with a strong light source seemingly coming from the upper left, casting a significant shadow on the right side of his face and neck. The background is a plain, dark reddish-brown or burnt orange color, which is out of focus and provides no detail.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is not high resolution. It appears somewhat blurry or soft, possibly due to the age of the photograph or the original source. The overall tone is somewhat muted and dark.

There is no text visible in the image. The focus is entirely on the man's portrait.

That's the logo for Discord, a popular communication application. 


The image shows a solid, round, periwinkle blue circle. Centered within the circle is the Discord logo: a stylized white face, somewhat resembling a simplified cartoon ghost or friendly emoticon. It has a rounded, somewhat square head with two large, simple, round, light-blue eyes. The mouth is a simple, slightly curved line at the bottom.  The overall shape is friendly and somewhat playful. There is no text in the image; only the logo itself.
