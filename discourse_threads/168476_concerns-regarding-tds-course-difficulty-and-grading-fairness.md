Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi

First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the **TDS team** in supporting us throughout this course. The **live sessions and guidance** have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.

However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.

**Key Challenges Faced**
------------------------

### **Lack of Prerequisites**

This course did not list any **prerequisites**, leading many students—including those from **non-technical backgrounds**—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the **course content, assignments, and projects** have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.

### **Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure**

The **difficulty of the projects** has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to **rely heavily on peer support** just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.

### **Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback**

Many students joined **TDS** based on past **Discourse posts and feedback**, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for **working professionals** and students without prior experience.

### **Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)**

While we have put in significant effort—spending **2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)** to secure good scores—we still find ourselves **struggling to meet expectations** for the **projects and RoE**, which are significantly harder than anticipated.

We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.

We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.

Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.
That's a digital image depicting a simple, stylized, pixelated blue diamond. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape and Color:** The main element is a diamond shape, rendered in a pixel art style.  The color is a medium-bright blue, appearing slightly glossy or reflective. The pixels are clearly visible, giving it a low-resolution aesthetic.

* **Background:** The background is pure black, providing strong contrast and making the blue diamond stand out prominently.

* **Style:** The overall style is reminiscent of older video games or simple digital art.  There's no texture beyond the implied glossiness from the shading.

The image is small and lacks any text or other details besides the blue diamond itself.
 That's a digital image of a single, small, light-blue, diamond-shaped object. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** It's clearly a diamond or rhombus, with four sides of roughly equal length and pointed corners.
* **Color:** The color is a light, somewhat bright blue.  It appears slightly glossy or reflective, suggesting a smooth surface.
* **Style:** The style is pixelated, indicating it's likely from a video game, low-resolution graphic, or similar digital art form. The edges are not perfectly smooth, but show the individual pixels.
* **Background:** The background is plain black, making the blue diamond stand out prominently.

There is no text or other objects in the image besides the blue diamond.
 That's a digital image depicting a single, pixelated, light-blue diamond shape. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** The object is a diamond or rhombus, meaning it's a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel.  It's not perfectly sharp-edged; the pixels give it a slightly softened appearance.

* **Color:** The color is a light, bright blue.  It appears somewhat glossy or reflective, with a subtle highlight effect suggested by pixel variations.

* **Pixelation:** The image is clearly made of pixels, visible as distinct squares of color. This gives it a low-resolution, almost retro or 8-bit video game aesthetic.

* **Background:** The background is pure black, providing a stark contrast that makes the blue diamond stand out prominently.

There is no text or other elements present in the image.
 That's a digital image of a small, stylized, blue diamond shape. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** It's a diamond or rhombus, not a perfect square; the sides are slightly slanted.

* **Color:** The color is a medium-to-light blue, appearing somewhat glossy or shiny due to slight shading effects that give it a three-dimensional look.

* **Style:** The style is simplistic, almost pixel-art-like in its low resolution and lack of intricate detail. The edges are somewhat blocky rather than smooth curves.

* **Background:** The background is pure black, providing a stark contrast to the blue diamond and making it the clear focal point.

There is no text present in the image.

Right,  
I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept.

I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock.

I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/6](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/6)

Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
Could you please look into the above issue?

Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:

### **Grading Concerns**

**Final Course Score:**  
T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F  
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)

From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:  
What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.  
Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.

Furthermore, for Project 1 (**deadline: 16th Feb 2025**), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.

### **Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues**

* Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals**, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.
* The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.
* The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.

### **Request for Improvement**

To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:

1. **Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2**, well in advance of the deadline.
2. **More structured and accessible support**, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.
3. **Better management of exam difficulty levels**, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.

I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.

Please look into it sir.

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/8](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/8)

Thank you @A\_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.

Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the **grading pattern will not be changed**. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.

1. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:

> **This course is quite hard**
>
> Here’s students’ feedback:
>
> * It *used* to be an easy course until 2024. # # #
> * Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #
> * Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #
> * LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #
> * The ROE is hard. #
>
> **Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.

2. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - *Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help*  
   Again to quote Anand:

> **We encourage learning by sharing**
>
> You *CAN* copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).
>
> **Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.
>
> **To learn well, understand** what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.
>
> **To learn better, teach** what you’ve learnt.

3. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).  
   Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble.
4. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.
5. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - *Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them* The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.
6. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.

Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.

I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.

While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.

I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.

Nicely highlighted the concern of all students.  
TDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It’s a headache for those with non-technical background.  
IITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis.

Dam… Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I’m still getting dragged into this   …
That's an emoji! 


It's a yellow circle representing a face, with the following features:

* **Eyes:** Two small, closed, curved lines suggesting a happy squint.
* **Mouth:** A wide, open, slightly uneven smile showing a pink tongue.
* **Sweat Droplet:** A single light-blue droplet is positioned near the upper right corner of the emoji's head. This suggests nervousness or exertion while still happy.

The overall style is typical of modern emojis, with smooth gradients and a slightly three-dimensional appearance to give it a glossy effect.  The expression conveyed is one of happy nervousness, or perhaps relieved laughter.
 That's an emoji depicting a face laughing very hard. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** It's a classic round emoji face, yellow in color.

* **Eyes:** The eyes are squinted shut, represented by two short, angled black lines, indicating intense laughter.

* **Mouth:** The mouth is wide open in a large, exaggerated grin, with the top and bottom lips clearly shown. The bottom lip is slightly pinker than the overall yellow tone of the face.

* **Overall Expression:** The overall expression is one of unrestrained, joyous laughter. The combination of closed eyes and wide-open mouth perfectly conveys the feeling of intense mirth.

The emoji is simple, yet effectively communicates a strong emotion.
 That's an emoji depicting a face laughing so hard it's crying. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Overall Shape:** A round, yellow circle representing the face.

* **Eyes:** The eyes are squinted shut, shown as two small, dark, V-shaped lines.

* **Mouth:** A wide, open mouth curving upward in a large, exaggerated smile.  There's a small, pink area visible within the mouth.

* **Tears:** Two large, light-blue teardrops are streaming down from the lower corners of the eyes.  This indicates laughter so intense it brings tears.

* **Style:** The style is cartoonish and simplified, typical of emoji design. The lines are somewhat bold, and the colors are bright and saturated.

The emoji effectively conveys uncontrollable, joyous laughter.

But still this is a huge Problem …

jkmadathil:

> LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #
That's an emoji depicting a neutral or unimpressed facial expression. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** It's a classic yellow circle, like most emojis.

* **Eyes:** The eyes are represented by two short, horizontal, dark lines.  They are positioned relatively close together and are completely flat, lacking any curve or detail to suggest emotion.

* **Mouth:** The mouth is a single, straight, horizontal, dark line. This simple, flat line contributes to the overall neutral or unimpressed expression.

* **Color:**  The overall color is a bright, uniform yellow. The eyes and mouth are a darker shade, perhaps brown or black.

The lack of curvature in the eyes and the straight, horizontal mouth line are key to its expression.  It's not happy, sad, angry, or surprised; it's simply...neutral.  The emoji often conveys indifference, boredom, or a lack of strong emotion.
 That's Hobbes, the tiger from the comic strip *Calvin and Hobbes*, by Bill Watterson.

The image shows a close-up of Hobbes lying down, seemingly on a light-colored surface (perhaps snow or a bed). 


Here's a breakdown of the visual details:

* **Hobbes:** He's depicted in his typical style: a stuffed tiger with orange and black stripes, large round eyes, and a simple, childlike design. He's lying on his side, his head slightly turned.  His paws are visible.

* **Background:** The background is plain and light-colored, with almost no detail. This keeps the focus entirely on Hobbes.

* **No text:** There's no visible text in the image.

The overall impression is a cute, simple depiction of Hobbes, consistent with the style of the *Calvin and Hobbes* comic strip.

Truly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well!

You will survive. Just watch tonight’s session.  and prepare and practise.
That's a digital image of a simple smiley-face emoticon. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a circular yellow emoji with a slight gradient, appearing slightly darker around the edges.

* **Facial Features:** It has two small, dark brown or black circular dots for eyes, positioned relatively close together. The mouth is a simple, slightly curved, thin dark line creating a subtle, content smile.  There's no nose depicted.

* **Style:** The style is minimalist and clean, characteristic of many commonly used emojis. The lines are smooth, and the overall aesthetic is friendly and unassuming.  It lacks any detailed shading or texture.

The image is purely graphic; there is no text.

That's a digital image of a small, blue, diamond-shaped object. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** It's a slightly rounded diamond or rhombus, not a perfectly sharp geometric shape.  The corners are softened.

* **Color:** The color is a medium-to-light blue, appearing somewhat glossy or reflective. It's not a flat, matte blue.

* **Style:** The style is simple and pixelated, suggesting it's likely from a video game, a low-resolution image, or created using pixel art techniques.  The edges are not smooth; you can clearly see individual pixels.

* **Background:** The background is completely black, making the blue shape stand out clearly.

There is no text or other objects present in the image.

Right,  
I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept.

I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock.

I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.

Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
Could you please look into the above issue?

Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:

### **Grading Concerns**

**Final Course Score:**  
T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F  
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)

From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:  
What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.  
Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.

Furthermore, for Project 1 (**deadline: 16th Feb 2025**), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.

### **Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues**

* Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals**, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.
* The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.
* The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.

### **Request for Improvement**

To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:

1. **Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2**, well in advance of the deadline.
2. **More structured and accessible support**, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.
3. **Better management of exam difficulty levels**, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.

I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.

Please look into it sir.

Thank you @A\_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.

Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the **grading pattern will not be changed**. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.

1. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:

> **This course is quite hard**
>
> Here’s students’ feedback:
>
> * It *used* to be an easy course until 2024. # # #
> * Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #
> * Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #
> * LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #
> * The ROE is hard. #
>
> **Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.

2. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - *Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help*  
   Again to quote Anand:

> **We encourage learning by sharing**
>
> You *CAN* copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).
>
> **Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.
>
> **To learn well, understand** what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.
>
> **To learn better, teach** what you’ve learnt.

3. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).  
   Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble.
4. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.
5. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - *Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them* The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.
6. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.

Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.

I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.

While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.

I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.

Nicely highlighted the concern of all students.  
TDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It’s a headache for those with non-technical background.  
IITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis.

Dam… Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I’m still getting dragged into this   …
That's an emoji! 


Specifically, it's a cartoon-style emoticon depicting a yellow face with a wide, open-mouthed laugh. The eyes are closed in a happy expression. A single, light-blue droplet of sweat is visible on the right side of the face, suggesting nervous laughter or a situation where the laughter is slightly strained or uncomfortable.  The overall style is consistent with modern emoji designs, featuring a slightly glossy or 3D-like effect to give the face some dimension.
 That's an emoji depicting a face laughing very hard. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape:** The emoji is a circle, representing a head.

* **Color:** The main color is a bright, sunny yellow. The inside of the mouth is a pinkish-red.

* **Facial Features:**
    * **Eyes:** The eyes are closed tightly, with small, dark, slanted lines indicating the squeezing of the eyelids from laughter.
    * **Mouth:** The mouth is wide open in a large, exaggerated smile, showing upper and lower teeth.  The tongue is slightly visible, and the lips are full.

The overall impression is one of unrestrained, joyful laughter. The style is consistent with modern emoji designs, utilizing simple, rounded shapes and bright colors.
 That's an emoji depicting a face laughing so hard it's crying. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Overall Shape:** A round, yellow circle representing the face.

* **Eyes:** The eyes are squinted shut, represented by two small, dark, V-shaped lines pointing downwards.

* **Mouth:** A wide, open mouth with a visible, slightly pink tongue or inner lining at the bottom, curved into a large smile.

* **Tears:** Two large, light blue teardrops are streaming down from the eyes, indicating laughter so intense it brings tears.

* **Style:** The emoji has a slightly cartoonish style, with simplified features and a smooth, glossy appearance.  The colors are bright and saturated.

The emoji is clearly expressing extreme amusement and joy.  There's no text present.

But still this is a huge Problem …

jkmadathil:

> LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #
That's an emoji depicting a neutral or unimpressed facial expression. 


Here's a breakdown:

* **Shape and Color:** The emoji is a round, bright yellow circle, typical of many emoji designs.

* **Facial Features:** The face features two short, horizontal, dark lines for eyes, positioned relatively close together.  Below the eyes is a single, longer, horizontal, dark line representing a neutral mouth. There's no curve or upturn or downturn to suggest happiness, sadness, or other strong emotions.

* **Overall Impression:** The overall impression is one of blandness, indifference, or mild displeasure. It's not an overtly negative emotion, but neither is it positive.  It conveys a sense of neutrality or mild skepticism.
 That's Hobbes, the tiger from the comic strip *Calvin and Hobbes*.

The image shows a close-up of Hobbes lying down, seemingly on a light-colored surface (possibly snow or a bed). 


Here's a breakdown of what's visible:

* **Hobbes:** He's depicted in his typical style: a plush, somewhat cartoonish tiger with orange and black stripes. His body is mostly visible, with his head turned slightly towards the viewer. His expression is somewhat neutral or possibly slightly mischievous, typical of his character.  He appears to be holding or interacting with something small and light-colored near his mouth, possibly a piece of paper or a toy.

* **Background:** The background is very simple, mostly a light off-white or light beige color with almost no detail. This focus on the simplicity of the background draws attention to Hobbes himself.

* **No Text:** There is no visible text in the image.

The overall style is consistent with Bill Watterson's distinctive art style in the *Calvin and Hobbes* comic strip. The image likely comes from a panel or strip from the comic.

Great! a nice post sir, I accept it is hard and I am harder than this too.

Truly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well!

Seeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir’s company lol. I am barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though remembering everything is super difficult.

You will survive. Just watch tonight’s session.  and prepare and practise.
That's a digital image of a simple, smiling emoticon. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** The emoticon is a bright yellow circle.  The yellow is a slightly golden hue, not a pure, flat yellow.

* **Facial Features:** It has two small, dark brown circles for eyes, positioned relatively close together. The mouth is a small, gently curved line, suggesting a subtle, contented smile.  The smile is understated; it's not a wide, exaggerated grin.

* **Style:** The style is simple and minimalistic. There's no shading or complex details. The features are basic geometric shapes. It resembles the style of emojis commonly used in digital communication.

* **Background:** The background is transparent, allowing the emoticon to be placed on any background without a distracting color.
