In every TDS assignment after the first, I have not seen a submit button in the assignment page so I could not submit it there( I see it in the sanand portal and submit it there)

Now, my assignment score for all assignments (2,3,4,5) shows 0

I am attaching SS of my assignment-5 page to show there was no submit button available there

I had raised this as a ticket in the Support desk(21/Feb) in the past as discourse was not available to me at that time, but this didn’t get resolved. I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying a web page from a course management system, likely used for online learning at IIT Madras.  The main content is focused on a "Graded Assignment 5."

**Key Features:**

* **Top Navigation Bar:** A standard browser toolbar is visible at the top, showing tabs for "What's New," "My Dashboard," "Graded Assignment," "Important Update," "Support Ticketing," and "Submit a Ticket."  The URL shows a course-specific address.

* **Left Sidebar (Navigation):**  This sidebar contains a navigation menu with sections for "Modules" and "Grades."  Under "Modules," several modules are listed, including "Deployment Tools," "Large Language Models," "Project 1," "Data Sourcing," "Data Preparation," and "Graded Assignment 5." Under "Grades" only the "Graded Assignment 5" section is visible.  A "Learning Feedback" section is also present.  The IIT Madras logo is visible at the top of the left sidebar.

* **Main Content Area:** This area dominates the screen and displays information about "Graded Assignment 5."  Specifically:
    * **Due Date:** Clearly highlights the due date and time in red: "2025-02-21, 23:59 IST".
    * **Submission Policy:**  States that multiple submissions are allowed before the deadline, with only the final submission being graded.
    * **Troubleshooting:** Provides a detailed list of potential problems students might encounter when accessing the assignment and offers solutions, such as disabling ad blockers, ensuring JavaScript is enabled, using a Chrome browser, disabling browser extensions, and ensuring antivirus software isn't overly aggressive. It also emphasizes using the student ID correctly.
    * **Assignment Link:** Includes a direct link to the assignment: "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga5".

* **Bottom Left:** A small icon labeled "Calc" is visible in the bottom left corner of the sidebar.


The overall impression is that this is a student's view of an online course assignment page, providing clear instructions and troubleshooting guidance.  The layout is clean and organized.

@22f3001561 GA5 like all the prior GAs for TDS Jan 25 term were all to be submitted through the graded assignment page. Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).  
All the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.

We have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.

Kind regards
