Please post any discrepancies related to project1.

@carlton

Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?
-------------------------------------------------------

All the image ids we evaluated were what *you* submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos *you* gave us.

For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

How to fix bugs in our scripts

@carlton Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.

We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.

I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error`.

@carlton same issue, My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Actually my image was run on x86\_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.

I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

@Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image shows a single, uppercase letter "D" in white.
*   The background is a solid, muted grayish-blue color.
*   The letter "D" appears to be slightly blurred or soft-edged, giving it a subtle glow or a sense of depth against the background.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

The image shows a section from a Docker image repository interface. The section details information about a specific tag of a Docker image.

Here are the details:

*   **Tag:** The tag highlighted is "latest" indicated by a green circular icon followed by the text "latest."
*   **Last Pushed:** Text indicating the image was last pushed "about 1 month" ago by the user "pradeeepmondal"
*   **Digest:** A digest value is displayed, specifically "a4d9cad3bf5."
*   **OS/ARCH:** This shows the operating system and architecture compatibility, displayed as "linux/arm64/v8."
*   **Last pull:** Indicates the last time the image was pulled, shown as "1 day."
*   **Compressed Size:** The compressed size of the image is "179.2 MB".

Next to the "latest" tag, the command for pulling the image is displayed:

`docker pull pradeeepmondal/final-to-ds-project-pradeep-mondal:latest`

There's a "Copy" button next to the pull command, enabling users to quickly copy it.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image shows terminal output. The terminal window appears to have a dark background, and the text is in a light color.

**Text Content:**

The output is structured as a sequence of lines.  Here's a breakdown:

1.  `→ ~ podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 047fa151bf43` This line looks like a command being executed. It uses the `podman` command to run a container. Here's a breakdown of the arguments:
    *   `run`: Indicates a new container is being run.
    *   `--rm`:  This flag tells podman to remove the container after it exits.
    *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`: Sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` within the container, the value being pulled from the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` on the system.
    *   `-p 8000:8000`:  Specifies port mapping, forwarding port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container.
    *   `047fa151bf43`: Likely the image ID or container name to run.

2.  `INFO: Started server process [1]` This indicates a server process has been started within the container.
3.  `INFO: Waiting for application startup.` The system is waiting for the application to initialize.
4.  `INFO: Application startup complete.` The application has successfully started.
5.  `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`:  Uvicorn is a web server, and this line confirms that Uvicorn is running, serving content on the specified address and port. It also provides a helpful tip on how to quit.

Roll no. 23f1002056
Here's a description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image features a bright pink or magenta square background.
*   In the center of the square is a large, white capital letter "R". The letter is slightly blurred, giving it a soft or glowing appearance.

**Key Features:**

*   **Letter "R":** The prominent feature is the white "R", suggesting it may be the main subject or identifier.
*   **Color:** The vibrant pink/magenta background creates a strong contrast with the white letter.
*   **Blur:** The blurred effect on the letter adds a stylistic touch, potentially indicating focus on the letter itself.

My evaluation log file is missing.  
The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.  
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,  
What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07

My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.  
tds-project-1 latest c854274f078d 5 weeks ago 1.38GB

@Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini
Certainly! Based on the image you sent, here's a detailed description:

**Content:**

The image contains a single letter "D" in white, displayed against a gray-blue background. The letter "D" is presented in a clean, sans-serif font with a slightly blurred or soft-edged appearance, giving it a subtle glow or halo effect. The background is a solid, muted gray-blue color, providing a contrast that makes the "D" stand out. There aren't any other objects, patterns, or distinguishing features within the image.
 Here's a description of the image, focusing on its content:

**General Layout and Context:**
The image appears to be a snippet from a software repository interface, likely showcasing information about a container image (e.g., Docker image).  It is a dark-themed UI.

**Key Information Displayed:**

*   **Tag:** Indicates a tag named "latest" with a green icon. It also tells that it was pushed about 1 month by 'pradeepmondal'.
*   **Digest:**  Displays a long hexadecimal string "a4d9cad3b5f5". This is a unique identifier for a specific version of the image.
*   **OS/ARCH:**  Indicates the operating system and architecture compatibility as "linux/arm64/v8".
*   **Last Pull:** Shows that the image was last pulled one day ago.
*   **Compressed Size:** The compressed size is shown as "179.2 MB".
*   **Docker Pull Command:** A command "docker pull pradeepmondal/final-tds-project-pradeep-mondal:latest" is displayed in a text box with a "Copy" button next to it.

In summary, the image provides essential details about a container image within a software repository, including its tag, unique identifier, OS/architecture, last pull timestamp, size, and a command to pull the image for use.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Text and Context**

The image displays terminal output, likely from running a command related to containerization (using podman).

*   **Command:** `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 047fa151bf43`
    *   `podman run`:  This indicates that a container is being run using podman.
    *   `--rm`: The container will be automatically removed after it exits.
    *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`:  An environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is being set within the container. It's using the value of the same variable on the host system (indicated by the `$`).
    *   `-p 8000:8000`:  Port 8000 on the host machine is being mapped to port 8000 within the container. This allows you to access a service running on port 8000 inside the container through port 8000 on your local machine.
    *   `047fa151bf43`:  This is likely the image ID or name of the container image being run.

*   **Output Messages:**
    *   `INFO: Started server process [1]` : A server process has been initiated within the container.
    *   `INFO: Waiting for application startup.` : The application inside the container is starting up.
    *   `INFO: Application startup complete.` : The application has successfully started.
    *   `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`: Uvicorn, an ASGI server, is running and listening on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) on port 8000. You can stop the application by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

**In Summary**

The image shows the successful startup of a containerized application using podman, likely an application using Uvicorn as its web server.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

*   **Overall:** The image appears to be a graphic or icon.
*   **Text:** The prominent feature is the capital letter "R."
*   **Color:** The background color is a vibrant magenta or dark pink.
*   **Letter Style:** The letter "R" is white and appears to have a blurred or slightly glowing effect around its edges, giving it a soft and diffused look.

Based on these features, it can be used as an avatar or branding for something related to the letter "R", or that uses a magenta color scheme.

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: d0f14a872042 , but i had never provided this docker image then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id.

Please, look over it.

@carlton @Jivraj  
I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.

* **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We *may* pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.  
  Regards,

Would you mind reviewing the evaluation.log screenshot I have attached? I believe I may deserve marks for Task B6. @carlton, could you kindly take a look?  

image1460×585 24.9 KB
The image shows the output of a test or script. It indicates that data was scraped and saved to a file named "b6.json" within the "/data" directory.  It also displays the HTTP request used to access that data (GET request to a local server). The important part is the comparison between the expected data and the actual result.  The "EXPECTED" array contains a list of author names.  The "RESULT" section shows a JSON object with a single key ".author" whose value is an array of author names.  The "B6 FAILED" at the bottom indicates that the test has failed, presumably because the "RESULT" does not match the "EXPECTED" list.  Specifically, the "RESULT" may contain values or ordering that do not match the expected result.

The task was done but the LLM made a mistake. I think this type of mistake was outside our control. @carlton
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout and Context:**

The image appears to be a log or output from a software testing or automated task execution environment. It shows the progress of a task involving image processing and an LLM (Large Language Model).  The various sections represent different steps in the process, including HTTP requests, task descriptions, and results.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **A7 PASSED (Top Left):** A green checkmark indicates that the "A7" test case has passed.
2.  **Task Description (Yellow Dot):**
    *   Indicates the task being executed.
    *   Text: "Running task: '/data/card.jpg' has a credit card. Pass the image to an LLM, extract the card number, and write it without spaces to '/data/cc-number.txt'"
3.  **HTTP Request (POST):**
    *   Shows a POST request sent to `http://localhost:8001/run`.
    *   The `task` parameter is heavily URL-encoded, describing the task. The encoded string includes:
        *   Referring to the image `/data/card.jpg`.
        *   Indicating that the image has a credit card.
        *   Instructing to pass the image to an LLM.
        *   Requesting the LLM to extract the card number.
        *   Specifying to write the extracted number without spaces to `/data/cc-number.txt`.
    *   The response is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

4.  **HTTP 200 (Success) Response (Green Dot):**
    *   Indicates a successful HTTP response (200 OK).
    *   The JSON response has a "result" field.
    *   Text: `"result": "The task of extracting the card number from the image and writing it to '/data/cc-number.txt' has been completed successfully."`

5.  **HTTP Request (GET):**
    *   Shows a GET request to `http://localhost:8001/read?path=/data/cc-number.txt`. This suggests the system is trying to read the contents of the file where the extracted card number was supposed to be written.
    *   The response is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

6.  **Result Verification (Red Dot):**
    *   Indicates a failure or issue related to the expected result.
    *   File: `/data/cc-number.txt`
    *   **Expected:**  `6011598665215965` (This is the correct/expected credit card number).
    *   **Result:** `6011598665215965` (The actual extracted card number)

**Observations and Conclusion:**

*   The core task is to extract a credit card number from an image using an LLM and save it to a file.
*   The initial task execution and file write appear to have been successful (HTTP 200 OK).
*   The extracted credit card number is identical to the expected number, so there are no errors in the card extraction.
*   It's unclear if there is a parsing error due to the red dots but everything seems to be identical.

Let me know if you want a further deep dive on any aspect of this image.

@carlton @Jivraj  
Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks **B7**, **B8**, and **B10**, the evaluation log does not include any **`POST` or `GET` request traces**, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.  

image2003×745 95 KB
The image shows a series of HTTP requests and responses, followed by task execution and error messages.

*   **HTTP Request 1:** A POST request to `http://localhost:8278/run` with a long, URL-encoded task description. The task involves scraping quotes and authors from a website, specifically `https://quotes.toscrape.com/`, extracting author names, and saving them to `/data/b6.json`.

*   **HTTP Response 1:** HTTP/1.1 200 OK. The status is "success". The response includes the task description in a more readable format. It also shows the "generated\_code" that was executed. This code uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to scrape the website, extract author names, and save them as a JSON file.

*   **HTTP Request 2:** A GET request to `http://localhost:8278/read?path=/data/b6.json`

*   **HTTP Response 2:** HTTP/1.1 200 OK. The task to read `/data/b6.json` was successful.

*   **Task B6 Status:** PASSED.

*   **Next Task (with errors):** A task to download an image from `https://dummyimage.com/100x100/ad0434/ad0434.png`, resize it to 50x50 pixels, and save it as `/data/b7.png`.

*   **Errors:** Tasks B7 and B8 failed. The error message for B8 indicates "not all arguments converted during string formatting". It is repeated twice. The image does not provide more details on the cause of the failures.

Here's a detailed description of the image's content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of a phone screen, displaying a text-based message, likely feedback or results from an evaluation process. The content seems related to Docker images, server performance, and technical assessment.

**Top Section:**

*   **Status Bar:** Shows the time "3:12," battery level, network indicators, and other common phone icons.
*   **Initial Text:** The first few lines explain that the evaluation failed, possibly due to a misconfigured Docker image. It encourages the user to contact them if they believe it's an error. It also states that missing files will result in a score of 0.
*   **Performance Specifications:** Mentions that the Docker image is expected to be responsive within 5 minutes of launch. It clarifies that the evaluations were run on an 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit, so server performance shouldn't be a bottleneck. Network bandwidth is stated to be 1 Gigabit, which is described as 5 times faster than domestic internet.

**List of Files (Evaluation Details):**

A numbered list details various files related to the evaluation process.

1.  **Evaluation log file:** Marked as "MISSING." It should contain the performance report on individual tasks.
2.  **Docker log file:** A Google Drive link is provided. It supposedly contains the technical performance of the container. The link itself is: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zn-ajY5yB1M1xxhraquPcPFNvqe7-ebC/view?usp=drivesdk`
3.  **Server start log file:** (See attachment) Contains separate logs for ARM vs x86 architectures. Important if the Docker service failed to start or respond.
4.  **Evaluation script file:** (See attachment) Separate logs for ARM vs x86. This file has the actual tests that were run against the submission and the scoring mechanism.
5.  **Data generation file:** (See attachment) The evaluation file depends on this file to create the data for the tasks.
6.  **Docker orchestration file:** (See attachment) Manages Docker image retrieval from Docker Hub, container instance launching, required environment variables, and port mappings.
7.  **Solution script:** (See attachment zip) This file solves the entire project 1 using prompt engineering only.

**Footer Section:**

*   **Docker Image ID:** "This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: e1f186d9ce91"
*   **Bottom edge of screen:** Shows indicators for unread emails (99+) and notifications (9).

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The evaluation process encountered issues.
*   Critical files are missing, resulting in a low score.
*   The message provides details on accessing logs and understanding the evaluation process.
*   The Docker image ID is provided.

Hi @all

We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.

We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

23f3003302:

> Hi @jivraj,

@23f3003302 output from your server’s response is correct, we will update our evaluation script.

23f2004912:

This was submitted to us through google form, for project1.

AYUSH\_SINGH:

> The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.

We are aware about it results for 12 students are not generated, we will look into it, and see what caused those 12 images not to run.

@22f1000703

22f1000703:

> My evaluation log file is missing in report provided. It says tasksA was not found. but I have submitted tasksA in my project file. Also it says server didnt start for 5 mins but for me image was working fine. please kindly help me out. I have made submissions correctly.

It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image contains a single letter "H" centered against a solid teal background.

**Details:**

*   **Letter:** The letter "H" is rendered in a simple, sans-serif font with a thin, white stroke. It appears slightly blurred or has a "glow" effect, giving it a soft appearance.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid teal color. There are no patterns, textures, or gradients visible in the background.
*   **Style:** The overall style appears modern and minimalist. The blur/glow effect suggests a possible focus on aesthetics rather than strict legibility.
 Here's a detailed description of the image's content, focusing on key elements:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a stylized, digital artwork. It evokes a sense of wonder, contemplation, and perhaps even a little bit of melancholy. It features a figure silhouetted against a dramatic, colorful sky.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Silhouetted Figure:** In the foreground, a figure is depicted from behind. The person is sitting or kneeling, perhaps in a meditative pose. It's impossible to discern details about the person's clothing or features due to the silhouette.
*   **Sky and Background:** The background is dominated by a dynamic and colorful sky. The colors blend and swirl, creating a dramatic effect. The colors range from blues and purples to oranges and reds. There appears to be the image of an explosion as well.
*   **Ground:** The figure seems to be sitting on or near a surface that is indistinct but appears to be either land, rock, or some textured element. This land is colored with orange and red colors as well.

**Possible Interpretations:**

*   **Contemplation:** The seated figure, combined with the dramatic sky, suggests a moment of contemplation or reflection.
*   **Connection to Nature:** The artwork may be trying to convey a sense of connection between humanity and the natural world.
*   **Inner Journey:** It is possible that this image is attempting to convey an inner journey that one is on.

If you have any specific questions about the image, feel free to ask!
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows the output of a program or test, likely related to scraping data and verifying results.

**Key Elements:**

1.  **Header Information:**

    *   `HTTP 200 "Scraped data saved to ./data/b6.json"`: Indicates that data was successfully scraped and saved to the specified JSON file.
    *   `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8052/read?path=/data/b6.json "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`: Shows a GET request to a local server to read the data from the `b6.json` file. The "200 OK" indicates a successful HTTP request.

2.  **Path Information:**

    *   `/data/b6.json`: This denotes the path to the JSON file in question.

3.  **Expected vs. Result:**

    *   `▲ EXPECTED:`:  Displays the expected list of author names from the data.  It includes names like "Albert Einstein", "J.K. Rowling", "Jane Austen", "Marilyn Monroe", "André Gide", "Thomas A. Edison", "Eleanor Roosevelt", and "Steve Martin."
    *   `▲ RESULT:`: Shows the actual result obtained. It's a JSON structure, with a field named ".author" (likely meaning `author`), which contains an array of strings representing author names. The author names are more or less the same as the expected list.

4.  **Discrepancy and Failure:**

    *   The expected list and the result list, although having mostly the same values, are in a different format.

5.  **Status:**

    *   `X B6 FAILED`: This indicates that the test case or operation named "B6" has failed. This is due to the difference between the "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" values.

**Observations:**

*   The test compares an expected array of author names with an extracted JSON structure.
*   The differences in format and certain name discrepancies, led to the "B6 FAILED" status.

In summary, the image captures a data scraping test scenario where the expected author list doesn't exactly match the extracted author list in the returned JSON data, causing the test to fail.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image is a simple graphic consisting of a single letter "A" centered against a purple background.

**Text:**

*   **Letter:** The primary element is the uppercase letter "A". It appears to be white or light gray with a slight glow or blur effect, making it stand out against the darker background.

**Objects/Features:**

*   **Letter Style:** The "A" appears to be in a clean, possibly sans-serif, font. The edges are slightly softened or blurred, contributing to a gentle glow effect.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid, even shade of purple.
*   **Arrangement:** The letter is centrally located within the image frame.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is minimalistic, focusing on a single letter and a simple color combination. It could potentially be used as an icon, logo element, or initial representation.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content, based on the provided OCR and visual hints:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot from a testing or debugging environment, showing HTTP requests and their responses, along with task execution status and error messages.

**Key Elements and their interpretation:**

1.  **HTTP Requests and Responses:**
    *   **POST Request:** The first request is a POST request to `http://localhost:8278/run`. The `task` parameter in the POST data seems to define a web scraping task related to quotes from famous people on the `quotes.toscrape.com` website. The goal is to extract and save author names to `/data/b6.json`.
    *   **HTTP/1.1 200 OK (First Response):** The first response indicates success. It includes:
        *   `status`: "success"
        *   `task`: Description of the scraping task, essentially restating the POST data intention.
        *   `generated_code`: Python code to perform the scraping. This code uses `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `json` to fetch the webpage, parse the HTML, extract author elements, and save the author list to a JSON file.
        *   `output`: (Empty string) - No output is displayed in the screenshot.
    *   **GET Request:** A GET request to `http://localhost:8278/read?path=/data/b6.json` is made, presumably to retrieve the JSON file created by the previous task.
    *   **HTTP/1.1 200 OK (Second Response):** Implies that the GET request was successful.

2.  **Task Execution Status:**
    *   ✅ **B6 PASSED:** Indicates that the scraping task associated with `/data/b6.json` was successfully completed.
    *   🟡 **Running task:** This indicates that a subsequent task is running. This task involves downloading an image from `https://dummyimage.com/100x100/ad0434/ad0434.png`, resizing it to 50x50 pixels, and saving it to `/data/b7.png`.
    *   ❌ **B7 failed:** - The task for saving the resized image to /data/b7.png failed.
    *   ❌ **B8 failed:** - The task with some string formatting issue also failed. It seems not all arguments were converted during string formatting.

**In summary:** The image depicts a scenario where a web scraping task was successfully executed, but an image manipulation task (downloading, resizing, and saving) and a task with string formatting issue failed. The HTTP requests, Python code snippet, and error messages all provide clues to the underlying processes and issues.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

*   **Content:** The image consists of a single, capital letter "H".
*   **Visual Appearance:**
    *   The "H" is white with a subtle glowing or blurred effect around it, making it appear slightly three-dimensional.
    *   The background is a flat, solid, medium-shade of blue or periwinkle.
    *   The letter is centered within the frame.

Overall, it's a simple and minimalist image of the letter "H" against a blue backdrop.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image features a bright, solid orange background. Positioned prominently in the center is a large, slightly blurred white letter "A". The "A" is a simple, sans-serif typeface.

**Key Features:**

*   **Color Palette:** The dominant colors are orange and white, creating a stark contrast.
*   **Text:** The presence of the letter "A" suggests a focus on alphabet, language, or initials.
*   **Blur:** The blurred effect gives the image a soft or slightly abstract feel.

This image is quite simple, making it hard to infer much more context without additional information.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image displays a blurred letter "A" in white, set against a solid, vibrant orange background. 

*   **Letter:** The letter "A" is prominently centered. It appears to be a simple, sans-serif font. Its blurred appearance gives it a soft, diffused look.
*   **Background:** The background is a uniform, bright orange color. The sharpness of the background color emphasizes the blurriness of the letter in the foreground.

The simplicity of the image focuses the viewer's attention entirely on the letter "A" and the contrast between its soft, blurred form and the solid, vibrant backdrop.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a selfie of a man. The lighting is indoor and appears to be artificial. The background is somewhat blurred, suggesting he's in a public space like a shopping mall or an office building lobby.

**Subject:**

*   **Man:** He is the central figure. He has short, dark hair styled upwards. He has a mustache and wears sunglasses with a dark tint. He's wearing a light-colored shirt, possibly a jacket or long-sleeved shirt over a darker undershirt.

**Background:**

*   **Blurred Interior:** The background is out of focus, but it seems to be an interior space. The warm tones suggest indoor lighting. I can see what appears to be a display screen, which could be an advertisement or informational panel. There are also indistinct shapes that might be other people or furniture.

**Key Features:**

*   **Sunglasses:** The sunglasses obscure the man's eyes, adding a cool or casual vibe to the image.
*   **Blurred Background:** Gives the image a sense of depth and helps the man stand out.
*   **Lighting:** The warm, artificial lighting contributes to the overall ambiance of the image.

**Possible Context:**

The image might be from a social media profile, a dating site, or simply a personal photo. The setting suggests he was out in a public place.

I suspect there is something wrong with how the evaluation has been done. Although A1 task succeeded, all of my A tasks failed.

@Jivraj , @carlton  
It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the `os` library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”

I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a log file displayed within a web browser (likely Google Chrome). The log appears to be from a program or application performing tasks involving file operations, HTTP requests, and potentially some kind of AI/LLM-related functionality. The log contains errors, warnings, and successful operations, indicated by different messages and HTTP status codes.

**Specific Elements:**

1.  **Browser Interface:**
    *   Browser tabs are visible at the top, suggesting navigation to various project-related pages, including "TDS" and "IITM".
    *   The URL bar shows `drive.google.com/file/d/1TeOWdllaRAyUQC7shZrOzBbFVnQZO92ca/view`. This indicates the log file is hosted on Google Drive.
    *   Buttons like "Open with Google Docs" and "Share" are present, typical of Google Drive's interface.

2.  **Log File Content:**
    *   The dominant portion of the image is filled with text from the log file.
    *   Errors are indicated by red indicators (circles) with messages like "A7 failed", "A8 failed".
    *   "HTTP 500" errors are present, indicating internal server errors. One example states "No such file or directory: '/app/.data/mail.txt'".
    *   "HTTP 404 Not Found" errors are also present, such as "GET http://localhost:8138/read?path=/data/mail-sender.txt HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found".
    *   There are descriptions of running tasks:
        *   "Running task: '/data/card.jpg' has a credit card. Pass the image to an LLM, extract the card number, and write it without spaces to '/data/cc-number.txt'"
        *   "Running task: '/data/comments.txt' contains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to '/data/comments-similar.txt', one per line".
    *   There is an HTTP request to "https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings" with an "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" response, suggesting a successful interaction with an OpenAI API for generating embeddings.

3.  **Date and Time:**
    *   The lower right corner displays the date and time: "08:39 AM 29-03-2023".

4.  **Operating System:**
    *   Based on the taskbar icons, the operating system is likely Windows 11.

5.  **Other Details:**
    *   A weather icon in the bottom left indicates "23°C Sunny".

**Interpretation & Potential Inferences:**

*   The application likely involves processing image data, extracting information with the help of an LLM, and performing operations on text data using embeddings.
*   There are file access issues ("No such file or directory") and routing issues ("404 Not Found") indicating problems with file paths or server configuration.
*   The application attempts to use an LLM (likely through an OpenAI API) to extract card numbers from images and compare comments for similarity.

In essence, the image is a snapshot of a debugging session showing errors encountered by a program interacting with files, a local server, and an external LLM API.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image is a screenshot of a web browser, most likely Google Chrome, displaying the code of a Python file on a GitHub repository. The screen is divided into three primary sections:

*   **Left Sidebar:** Contains a file explorer displaying the directory structure and files of a GitHub repository.
*   **Central Code Editor:** Displays the contents of a Python file named "app.py" within the editor interface of Github.
*   **Right Sidebar:** The symbols sidebar displaying a list of symbols from the code along with the type of symbol like const or func.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Browser Interface:**
    *   The browser tab displays "LLM-based-Automation-Agent / app.py".
    *   The URL shows a path within a GitHub repository: "github.com/Pritul-Raut/LLM-based-Automation-Agent/blob/main/app.py".

*   **Left Sidebar (Files):**
    *   A directory structure is visible, likely a "main" branch.
    *   Files listed in the directory include:
        *   Dockerfile
        *   LICENSE
        *   README.md
        *   **app.py** (Selected)
        *   package.json
        *   pyproject.toml
        *   uv.lock

*   **Central Code Editor (app.py):**
    *   The file "app.py" is open in the code editor.
    *   The programming language is Python, evident from the syntax.
    *   Key code snippets:
        *   `@app.get("/")`
        *   `async def start(): return "You are at the entrance URL. Just write /run or /read to perform the task."`
        *   `@app.get("/read")`
        *   `async def read_file(path: str):`
        *   Code involves reading files: `with open(path, "r") as file:`
        *   `@app.post("/run")`
        *   `async def run_task(task: str):`

*   **Right Sidebar (Symbols):**
    *   A list of symbols within the "app.py" file is displayed.
    *   Symbols include functions (func) and constants (const), like:
        *   `ai_proxy_url`
        *   `ai_proxy_embeddings_url`
        *   `ai_proxy_api`
        *   `app`
        *   `start`
        *   `read_file`
        *   `run_task`
        *   `function_caller`
        *   `tools`
        *   `task_describer`
        *   `is_path_in_data_folder`
        *   `data_installation`
        *   `format_markdown`
        *   `count_days`
        *   `sort_contacts`
        *   `recents_log`

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image shows a Python web application (`app.py`) being developed using a framework (likely FastAPI, based on the `@app.get` and `@app.post` decorators). The application likely interacts with files and executes tasks based on user input via API endpoints (`/run`, `/read`). The "LLM-based-Automation-Agent" project name suggests that the application likely involves large language models (LLMs) for automating tasks. The symbols sidebar provides a good overview of the functions and constants used within the "app.py" file.

I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86\_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.

Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong

@23f2001975 we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.

If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.

We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.

Kind regards

This is a screenshot of my docker log file. This works if you pass the actual value of the airproxy token at the command line while pulling the docker image. Please do look into this as I’ve put a lot of effort into this.

Thank you

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Main Content:** The image displays a Python traceback, indicating an error that occurred during the execution of a Python script.

**Text Breakdown:**

*   **"Traceback (most recent call last):"** - Standard header for Python traceback output.
*   **"File "/app/app.py", line 30, in <module>"** - Indicates the error originated in the file `/app/app.py` on line 30, within the main module of the script.
*   **`AIPROXY_TOKEN = os.environ['AIRPROXY_TOKEN']`** - This line of code is where the traceback points to. It attempts to retrieve the value of the environment variable named "AIRPROXY\_TOKEN" using the `os.environ` dictionary.
*   **squiggly lines**
*   **"File "<frozen os>", line 716, in \_\_getitem\_\_"`** - The traceback continues, indicating the error occurred in a frozen OS module's internal `__getitem__` method (used for accessing dictionary elements).
*   **"KeyError: 'AIRPROXY\_TOKEN'"** - This is the actual error: a `KeyError` exception. It means that the environment variable "AIRPROXY\_TOKEN" was not found in the `os.environ` dictionary. This means the python script tries to access "AIRPROXY\_TOKEN" from OS environment, but the environment is not setup correctly, or the "AIRPROXY\_TOKEN" does not exist in the OS.

**Interpretation:** The Python script `/app/app.py` relies on an environment variable named `AIRPROXY_TOKEN`. However, this environment variable is not set or available when the script runs. This causes a `KeyError` because the script is trying to access a key that doesn't exist in the `os.environ` dictionary.

@cartlon Same issue.

My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Can you please rerun the image on ARM based

You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page.

Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image displays a Python traceback error message. It shows the following:

*   **Traceback (most recent call last):** Indicates the start of the traceback information.

*   **File "/app/app.py", line 30, in <module>** Specifies the file and line number where the error occurred. The file is "app.py" located in the "/app/" directory, and the error occurred on line 30 within the `<module>` scope.

*   **AIPROXY\_TOKEN = os.environ['AIRPROXY\_TOKEN']**: This line shows the Python code that caused the error. It attempts to retrieve the value of an environment variable named "AIRPROXY\_TOKEN" using `os.environ`.

*   **File "<frozen os>", line 716, in \_\_getitem\_\_**: This indicates that the error originated within the `os.environ` function's `__getitem__` method, which is used to access environment variables.

*   **KeyError: 'AIRPROXY\_TOKEN'**: This is the actual error message, indicating that the environment variable "AIRPROXY\_TOKEN" was not found.

In essence, the error occurs because the Python script is trying to access an environment variable called "AIRPROXY\_TOKEN", but that variable is not defined in the environment where the script is being run.

We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.

Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.

If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.

Kind regards

@carlton

I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:

```
{
"detail": "'choices'"
}

```

This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY\_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?

Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.

Screenshot 2025-03-29 1033271511×749 29 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows the output of a script or program, likely related to data processing or formatting. It displays a series of actions, requests, and error messages. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Running Task 1:** "Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/f19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a/raw/13246698088795e1942179856aafd466052b66ae/datagen.py` with `22f3001777@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` as the only argument"
    *   This indicates the script is attempting to install `uv` (if not already present) and then execute a script located at the provided URL. The script runs with a specific email address provided as an argument.
2.  **HTTP Request (POST):** "http://localhost:8180/run?" followed by a long encoded string.
    *   This appears to be an attempt to send a POST request to a local server on port 8180 to trigger the `uv` installation and script execution. The encoded string represents the task to be performed, likely including the URL of the script and the email address argument.
3.  **HTTP Error:** "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"
    *   This is a critical error indicating that the server at `localhost:8180` encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

4. **HTTP 500**
    * Contains `detail": ""choices'"`
5.  **HTTP Request (GET):** "http://localhost:8180/read?path=/data/format.md" followed by "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"
    *   The script attempts to retrieve a file named "format.md" from the `/data/` directory on the server, but it receives a "404 Not Found" error, indicating that the file does not exist at the specified path.
6.  **Error Message:** "A1 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md"
    *   This message explicitly states that the script was unable to read the "format.md" file. The "A1" label might refer to a specific component or stage of the script where the failure occurred.
7.  **Marked Failure:** "X A1 FAILED"
    *   This further emphasizes that a specific part of the code, labeled "A1," has failed.
8.  **Running Task 2:** "Format `/data/format.md` with `prettier@3.4.2` in-place"
    *   The script tries to format the `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`.
9. **HTTP Request (POST):** "http://localhost:8180/run?task=Format+%60%2Fdata%2Fformat.md%60+with+%60prettier%403.4.2%60+in-place" followed by "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"
    *   This appears to be another attempt to send a POST request to a local server on port 8180 to trigger the formatting of a local file.
10. **HTTP Error:** "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"
    *   This is a critical error indicating that the server at `localhost:8180` encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

11. **HTTP 500**
    * Contains `detail": ""choices'"`

12.  **HTTP Request (GET):** "http://localhost:8180/read?path=/data/format.md" followed by "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"
    *   The script attempts to retrieve a file named "format.md" from the `/data/` directory on the server, but it receives a "404 Not Found" error, indicating that the file does not exist at the specified path.
13.  **Error Message:** "A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md"
    *   This message explicitly states that the script was unable to read the "format.md" file. The "A2" label might refer to a specific component or stage of the script where the failure occurred.
14.  **Marked Failure:** "X A2 FAILED"
    *   This further emphasizes that a specific part of the code, labeled "A2," has failed.

**In Summary:** The script experiences multiple failures:

*   An internal server error occurs when trying to install and run a script, which means the initial attempt fails.
*   The script is unable to locate the "format.md" file, which leads to "404 Not Found" errors and prevents further processing.
*   An internal server error occurs when trying to format the local file, which means the second attempt fails.

The presence of both "500 Internal Server Error" and "404 Not Found" errors suggests there may be multiple underlying issues, such as problems with the server configuration, the availability of the script at the provided URL, or the existence/location of the "format.md" file.

I encountered the same issue with `evaluate.py`. However, since you previously advised against coding strictly with `evaluate.py`, I didn’t pursue it further. Now, I’m concerned—how is this a mistake?

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image shows text output, likely from a software testing process or log file analysis.
*   It appears to be comparing "EXPECTED" results with "RESULT" outputs.
*   The overall test or process has "FAILED".

**Textual Content:**

*   **File Path:** At the top, it indicates the source file: `/data/logs-latest.txt`.
*   **"▲ EXPECTED:"** This section presents the expected outcome, likely a set of strings or phrases.
*   **"▲ RESULT:"** This section shows the actual output that was obtained.
*   **String Content:** The text following both "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" consists of a series of seemingly unrelated phrases or sentences, such as:
    *   "Clearly drug health quickly field everyone majority as. Investment direction themselves suddenly."
    *   "West son we reflect. Size quite they new assume manager."
    *   "Official one draw various between time box goal."
    *   "Hair hit rule employee."
    *   "Option guess fish difficult our add."
    *   "Within PM race former. Pressure property piece treat thus interesting. Eight so affect."
    *   "Different indicate pretty most pay leg today."
    *   "Clear your upon sign. Type per task win."
    *   "Consumer beyond economy easy friend piece increase. With city write."
    *   "Matter statement last trial television. Not black owner most million answer. Toward contain girl member."
*   **"X A5 FAILED"** At the very bottom, this indicates that a specific test case (A5) has failed. The "X" likely signifies the failure.

**Analysis:**

*   The image represents a comparison between expected and actual outcomes in some kind of automated process.
*   The seemingly random phrases suggest the test might be related to natural language processing, text generation, or some form of string manipulation.
*   Because the "RESULT" section is an exact copy of the "EXPECTED" section, it indicates that while there were no variations between them, the test expected a variation.

In essence, the image shows a failed software test related to string or text processing, where the actual output didn't match the expected transformation.

This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 468630ef32b8  
I believe this is not my docker ID that was submitted, my docker ID is “bd2d0e570ec6”:

Please, look over it.

Also, in my docker log file, it is showing the error as:

@Jivraj @carlton
The image shows a log output, likely from a Python application, indicating an error during the execution of a task. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

**Initial Setup:**

*   The log starts with information about the server starting up, indicating a Uvicorn server running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

**Task Execution:**

*   The application is running a task called "Say Hello Carlton".

**Function Call:**

*   The application attempts to execute a function named "extract\_specific\_text\_using\_llm".
*   The arguments passed to this function include `"input_file": "system_input.txt"`, `"output_file": "output.txt"`, and `"task": "Say Hello Carlton"`.

**Error:**

*   A `FileNotFoundError` occurs, specifically, "\[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'system\_input.txt'". This suggests the application is unable to locate the input file.

**Tracebacks:**

*   The log includes tracebacks showing the call stack leading to the error. These tracebacks indicate the error originates in `function_tasks.py` within the `extract_specific_text_using_llm` function, specifically when attempting to open the `input_file_path`.
*   The error is then propagated through `main.py` in the `execute_function_call` and `run_task` functions.

**HTTP Exception:**

*   The application raises an `HTTPException` with a status code of 500, indicating an internal server error.

**Other Info**

*   There are some 'costError' reported: "crypto.createlash is not a function"

**In summary, the error is caused by the application's inability to find the "system\_input.txt" file, which is required for the "extract\_specific\_text\_using\_llm" function. This then causes the application to raise an internal server error.**

Yes, I agree.  
So, did my docker ID change when I submitted?  
I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really don’t know where I have went wrong.

Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to confirm the same for me.  
*" I looked for your response for project1 docker image, and found out that we used correct image id. Here is repo information `harshjaiswal1/tds_project_final latest d0f14a872042 5 weeks ago 214MB` "*

Also sir, could you please tell me why the error as shown in my previous message is being shown? and if there is no chance of it getting correct.

thanks

Hi @carlton !

I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!

Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.

@carlton,

Jivraj said, *“We will discuss internally if we can do something about it.”* I understand this well. The output from my server is slightly different, but it still achieves over 95% accuracy. Please do consider it.

Hi @22f2001389

```
  File "/app/app.py", line 4, in <module>
    from tasksA import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tasksA'

```

The error occurs because Python cannot find the `tasksA` module. This is due to the file not existing, not being in the correct directory.

Kind regards

Try running docker container after pulling, check if evaluate.py is able to do it’s job.

If you feel there is some issues from our side, we have provided with scirpts we used. You can create a pull request to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image displays a letter "R" rendered in white with a subtle glowing effect. The background is a solid, vibrant shade of reddish-pink or magenta.

**Key Features:**

*   **Letter:** The prominent element is the letter "R". It is capitalized and appears to be a clean, sans-serif font.
*   **Color Palette:** The image has a limited color palette: white for the letter and a rich pink/magenta for the background. This simplicity makes the letter stand out.
*   **Glowing Effect:** The subtle glow around the letter gives it a slight three-dimensional quality and enhances its visibility.
*   **Presentation:** The letter is centered within the frame, creating a balanced composition.

**Possible Interpretation and Usage:**

This image could be used as a placeholder for an initial, a logo element, or a part of a larger design. The color and glow effect could convey a sense of modernity, technology, or even a hint of glamour.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:**
The image is a screenshot of a terminal session (likely Linux/Unix-based), showing commands related to Docker and their output.

**Top Section:**

*   **User and Prompt:** `user_22f3002542_ds_study_iitm_ac_@tds-course-temp-bq:~$` - This shows the current user, hostname, and directory in the terminal. It's the standard prompt you see in terminal sessions.
*   **Docker Pull Command:** `docker pull --platform arm64 rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` - This is a command to download (or update) a Docker image.
    *   `docker pull`:  The command to pull a Docker image from a registry.
    *   `--platform arm64`:  Specifies that the image should be compatible with the ARM64 architecture.
    *   `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3`:  The name and tag of the Docker image to pull.  "rohit23f1001156" is likely a Docker Hub username/organization, "project1_tds" is the image name, and "v3" is the tag (version).
*   **Pulling Status:**
    *   `v3: Pulling from rohit23f1001156/project1_tds` - Indicates that the download is starting.
    *   `Digest: sha256:bd2d0e570ec6b9a4a2b1565602a7c6abd118c4df06ca39e9dd78b0c06cab7542` -  The unique identifier (SHA256 hash) of the image layers being pulled.
    *   `Status: Downloaded newer image for rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` - Confirms that the image has been successfully downloaded (or that an update was downloaded).
    *   `docker.io/rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3` - The location from where the docker image got pulled from.

**Bottom Section:**

*   **User and Prompt (again):**  `user_22f3002542_ds_study_iitm_ac_@tds-course-temp-bq:~$` - Shows the user prompt again.
*   **Docker Images Command:** `docker images | grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"` - This command lists all the Docker images stored locally and filters the output to show only those that match the specified image name.
    *   `docker images`:  Lists the locally stored Docker images.
    *   `|`:  A pipe, used to redirect the output of the `docker images` command to the `grep` command.
    *   `grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"`:  Filters the output of `docker images` to show only lines containing the specified image name.
*   **Output of Docker Images:** `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds v3 468630ef32b8 5 weeks ago 581MB` - The output shows the details of the image that was pulled and is stored locally.
    *   `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds`: Image name.
    *   `v3`:  Image tag/version.
    *   `468630ef32b8`:  Image ID (a shortened version of its hash).
    *   `5 weeks ago`:  The image was created or updated 5 weeks prior to the date of the screenshot.
    *   `581MB`:  The size of the image.
*   **User and Prompt (again):** `user_22f3002542_ds_study_iitm_ac_@tds-course-temp-bq:~$~` - The user prompt again. The "~" likely indicates the user's home directory.

**In summary, the image shows the process of pulling a specific Docker image for the ARM64 architecture and then verifying that the image is now stored locally.**
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image features the letter "R" in a sans-serif font.
*   The letter is white with a blurred, slightly glowing effect, which gives it a soft or illuminated appearance.
*   The background is a solid, deep pink or magenta color.
*   The letter "R" is centered within the image frame.

**Key Features:**

*   The color contrast between the white "R" and the pink background makes the letter visually prominent.
*   The soft blur effect adds a sense of depth and visual interest.
*   The simplicity of the design suggests that it could be used as an icon, logo, or initial.

image2160×3840 1.92 MB
Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Overview:**

The image shows a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) window. It's displaying a project directory structure on the left and a code editor on the right, along with some UI elements of Windows.

**Left Side (Project Explorer):**

*   **File and Folder Structure:** It lists a file system, likely the contents of a project directory. The files are:
    *   pip.exe
    *   pip3.13.exe
    *   pip3.exe
    *   python.exe
    *   pythonw.exe
    *   .gitignore
    *   pyvenv.cfg
    *   .dockerignore
    *   .env
    *   app.py (currently selected/highlighted)
    *   datagen.py
    *   docker-compose.deb...
    *   docker-compose.yml
    *   Dockerfile
    *   evaluate.py
    *   requirements.txt
    *   tasksA.py

*   **Icons:** Each file type has a corresponding icon. For instance, .py files are represented by a Python logo, while directories have a folder icon. The icons also indicate the type of file, such as executables (`.exe`), configuration files (`.cfg`), and text files (`.txt`).

**Right Side (Code Editor/Terminal):**

*   **Code Snippets:**  A snippet of code is visible. It shows line numbers on the left (17-22) and some parenthesis.

*   **Problems Tab:** The PROBLEMS tab is being shown in the bottom with an error or warning
*   **Terminal:**  A Powershell console is being shown with the path: `O PS C:\Users\Ri`

**Bottom of the Screen (Windows UI):**

*   **Taskbar:**  The Windows taskbar is visible.
    *   **VS Code Icons:**  The VS Code icon is present.
    *   **Notifications:**  There is an icon showing a warning or error status. There is also a message "Python extension loading..."
    *   **Search Bar:** The "Type here to search" bar is visible.

**General Observations:**

*   **Programming Context:** The file extensions (.py, docker-compose.yml, requirements.txt) indicate a Python project, likely involving Docker.
*   **Project Structure:** The presence of `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml` suggests the project is under version control (Git) and containerized using Docker.
*   **VS Code Environment:** The VS Code interface provides tools for code editing, debugging, and project management.
*   **User:** The file paths (e.g., `C:\Users\Ri...`) reveal a specific user directory.

Let me know if you have specific questions you'd like answered based on this image.

Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker container.  
Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY app.py /app

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

@carlton good afternoon sir,  
I completed my project 1 and submitted it as instructed. But the result show that evaluate file missing. I did everything right but don’t know how this as the result come. I also had evaluation file in my project too. Please go through things again as this is very unfair for those who took 2 weeks to do this project. My roll no. is 22f3001664. I hope I will get marks, of not full then should be 10/20.  
Thank you sir

image474×474 41.7 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overview:**

The image is a meme showing an unfinished stadium with the caption "WHEN YOU CANNOT REFACTOR THE CODE BECAUSE OF A TIGHT DEADLINE." The image humorously relates the messy and unfinished construction of the stadium to the challenges of software development, where developers may have to take shortcuts and leave code in a less-than-ideal state due to time constraints.

**Detailed Description:**

*   **Visual Scene:** The central focus is an unfinished stadium. It appears to be a large sports venue, likely for soccer or football. The stadium is only partially constructed. A section of the stands is covered in red seating and supported by a scaffolding structure, which is visible. In the background, buildings and a cityscape suggest that this stadium is located in an urban area.

*   **Text Elements:**
    *   **Top:** "WHEN YOU CANNOT REFACTOR THE CODE"
    *   **Bottom:** "BECAUSE OF A TIGHT DEADLINE"
    *   The text is written in a white, sans-serif font with a thick black outline, a common style for memes.

*   **Objects and Features:**
    *   **Stadium:** The primary object. Details include the uncovered seating areas, the playing field (which appears green and ready for use), and the incomplete sections covered in red seating and scaffolding.
    *   **Scaffolding:** The visible scaffolding represents a temporary structure often used during construction projects to support workers and materials.
    *   **Cityscape:** The buildings and urban setting provide context for the location of the stadium.

**Meme Context:**

The image is humorous because the unfinished stadium stands as a visual metaphor for unrefined or poorly optimized computer code. The construction process is compared to the code refactoring process. In software development, "refactoring" refers to improving code without changing its functionality. In the context of a tight deadline, developers might have to choose the quickest solution over the best one, resulting in "messy" code (like the unfinished stadium).

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.

Line number 81 of your app.py

`subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)`

which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.

@Jivraj @carlton

I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.

These are the detailed point wise concerns :

1. I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.
2. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.
3. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.
4. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.

I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.

Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.

I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

Thanks and Regards

Few Students including me have not received any mails regarding TDS Project 1. We don’t even know what went wrong or why we didn’t received. Initially I thought that it can be due to some sending error and i will receive little late but even after 14hrs we have not received anything from the team. How are we supposed to check log and see our mistakes when we didn’t even received marks and logs. I request to check into it and provide us our marks and logs.

Screenshot 2025-03-29 1414481387×674 42.1 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image appears to be a screenshot of a directory listing within a code repository, likely from a platform like GitHub or GitLab.

**Textual Content:**

*   **Directory Path:** "TDS\_Project\_1 / App /"  This indicates the current location within the repository.
*   **User and Commit Message:** "RaunakNarwal735 Update Dockerfile" This shows the user who made the last commit to the currently displayed directory and the commit message.
*   **Commit Hash:** "c07b746 - last month" This represents a shortened commit hash and how long ago the commit happened.
*   **Column Headers:** "Name", "Last commit message", "Last commit date" These label the information displayed in the table below.
*   **File/Directory Names:** The directory listing includes:
    *   ".." (parent directory)
    *   ".env"
    *   "Dockerfile"
    *   "app.py"
    *   "readme.md"
    *   "tasksA.py"
    *   "tasksB.py"
*   **Commit Messages:**
    *   "Add files via upload" is a recurring message, likely indicating that the files were initially added through a web interface.
    *   "Update Dockerfile" specifically refers to a change made to the Dockerfile.
    *   "Create readme.md" indicates the creation of the readme file.
*   **Commit Dates:**  "last month" is consistently used for the files/directories in the table.
*   **Other Text:**
    *   "Add file" is present as a button, likely to add a new file to the directory.
    *   "History" is a link next to the commit hash.

**Objects and Features:**

*   **File Icons:**  File icons are displayed next to each file name, indicating file type. These appear to be generic document icons.
*   **Folder Icon:** A folder icon is next to the parent directory entry "..".
*   **Table Layout:** The content is presented in a tabular format, clearly organizing the file/directory name, commit message, and commit date.
*   **Buttons:** The presence of "Add file" indicates interactive functionality for the user to add content.
*   **History Link:** The "History" link probably shows a detailed commit history for the current directory.

In summary, the image depicts a directory listing in a code repository, showing various files, their last commit messages, and the timing of those commits. It highlights recent activity in the directory and provides options for adding new files.

linux/amd64  
which form should i fill sir?
Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:** The image appears to be a snippet of information, possibly from a software repository or package management system. It presents details about a specific tag (version) of a piece of software.

**Text Elements:**

*   **"TAG"**: Label indicating the tag associated with the software.
*   **"latest"**: The tag itself, likely indicating the most recent version. It has a green dot next to it, suggesting it's the active or recommended version.
*   **"Last pushed about 1 month by 23f2000599"**: Information about when the tag was last updated, and the user/entity responsible (represented by the identifier "23f2000599").
*   **"Digest"**: Indicates the cryptographic hash (or checksum) of the associated software.
*   **"5217284cc507"**: The actual digest value (a long hexadecimal string).
*   **"OS/ARCH"**: Indicates the operating system and architecture that the software is intended to run on.
*   **"linux/amd64"**: The operating system and architecture supported by this version, specifically Linux on the AMD64 (x86-64) architecture.

**Visual Features:**

*   The background is dark, possibly a dark mode theme.
*   The text is primarily light, providing good contrast against the dark background.
*   There's a clear separation between labels (like "TAG", "Digest", "OS/ARCH") and the corresponding values.

**In Summary:** The image shows information about the "latest" tag of a software package, including when it was last updated, its cryptographic digest (for verification), and the target operating system and architecture. It suggests that the software is compatible with Linux running on AMD64 processors.

Aditya\_Naidu:

> 21f3003062@ds.study.iitm.ac.in , My roll is in x86 list/log , not in ARM list/log. I have written and tested my code on ARM computer. I request to please check my code manually. @Jivraj @carlton .

please fill the form for collecting architecture, so that we can rerun evals earlier we relied on docker api to tell us which architecture is being used, but it didn’t classify them correctly.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a green square with the letter "A" in the center. The letter is white with a blurred or soft-focus effect, giving it a slightly glowing appearance. The background is a solid, muted green.

**Key Features:**

*   **Text:** The only text present is the letter "A."
*   **Color:** The dominant colors are green (background) and white (letter).
*   **Shape:** The background is a square.
*   **Blur:** The letter "A" appears blurred, which might be intentional for aesthetic purposes.
*   **Font:** The specific font of the letter "A" is not immediately apparent due to the blur, but it seems to be a simple and relatively clean sans-serif font.

Hi @23f2002400

Check your Dockerfile if it copies tasksA.py file to docker container.  
If it does where does it copy, these are possible mistakes. You were expected to test docker images.

One issue file is my app is listening on port 8000. But evaluations being done on 8219 port. so how it will succeed. Please guide what to do.

---
That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won’t create issues.

Just look at docker\_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.

There is a mistake in the url I guess check this out I have a fully functional image which was pushed 1 month ago  

image1103×611 55.7 KB

Please check this out

url::https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pscodes24/dataworks-agent/general
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web application interface, specifically a Docker image repository management page.  It has a dark theme.

**Header Section:**

*   **Repository Name:**  "pscodes24/dataworks-agent" is the name of the Docker image repository.
*   **Metadata:**  There's text indicating the image was "Last pushed about 1 month ago" and the "Repository size: 490.1 MB."

**Navigation/Tabs:**

This is the correct answer, eval script is not considering newlines properly. @Jivraj @carlton
The image shows a failed test case for a markdown formatting exercise.

*   **Top:** It starts with "/data/format.md", indicating the file being tested. A red dot is positioned next to the file name.

*   **EXPECTED:**  This section displays the expected output for the formatting.
    *   "# Header": A level 1 header.
    *   A table with three columns: "Start", "Mid", and "End", with left, center, and right alignment respectively.
    *   The table contains data in the corresponding columns: "1", "2", and "3".
    *   A paragraph that includes the text "Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace."
    *   A Python code block (indicated by ```py) that prints the email address "23f3001745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".

*   **RESULT:** This section shows the actual output produced by the code. It contains:
    *   The header "# Header" followed by escaped newline characters ("\n").
    *   The table with "Start", "Mid", and "End" along with the alignment rows (":---", "| --- |", "| --: |").
    *   The data "1", "2", and "3" in their respective columns, followed by newline characters.
    *   The paragraph: "Paragraph has extra spaces and trailing whitespace", followed by newlines.
    *   The Python code block (indicated by ```py) and the `print` statement.
    *   The whole text is represented with escaped special characters.

*   **Bottom:** "A2 FAILED" in red, indicating that the test case A2 did not pass.

In summary, the test failed because the generated markdown output did not precisely match the expected output. The differences likely involve newline characters, alignment, and escaping of special characters.

same with me  i dont understand how i got 0.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image depicts a digital emoji.

*   **Subject:** It is a round, yellow smiley face.
*   **Facial Features:**
    *   It has simple, dark brown eyes.
    *   It has a curved, smiling mouth.
    *   A single, light blue teardrop is positioned just below and to the side of the mouth on the left side of the face.

**Overall Impression:**

The emoji conveys a mixed emotion. The smile suggests happiness or contentment, while the teardrop implies sadness or perhaps a hint of irony, like "smiling through tears" or a bittersweet feeling.

Sir, my evaluation log file is missing, even though I followed all the steps to generate the Docker image correctly. The system indicates that the server didn’t start within 5 minutes, but when I uploaded it, everything was working fine. I put in a lot of effort into this project, and I’m worried I might receive a zero despite making the submission correctly. Kindly help me resolve this issue. My roll number is 22F3004068.

Additionally, my Docker image ID was **d2f27c03b878**, but the ID mentioned in the email was **dfac8596cd4c**. Please provide clarity on this discrepancy.

I have also attached my Docker log file for reference

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path\_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.

I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2

Sir so the user\_email isn’t passed while pulling the docker image?

Thank you.
The image shows a traceback in a Python program. The traceback indicates that a `KeyError` occurred because the environment variable `USER_EMAIL` was not set. Specifically, the error originated in the file `/app/main.py`, on line 22, where the code `USER_EMAIL = os.environ["USER_EMAIL"]` attempts to retrieve the value of this environment variable. The traceback also provides a full call stack, starting from the entry point of the `uvicorn` application.

Hello,

My log file shows a “file not found” or “directory not found” error. Could you confirm whether `datagen.py` was executed inside the Docker container or on the host OS? If it ran on the host, I don’t see any mounting process for the `/data` folder into the container. Could you please clarify this?

Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Image:**
The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal window or console output, likely from a web server application running in a development environment. It shows the server's startup information, followed by traceback error messages related to Flask (a Python web framework).

**Text Content:**

1.  **Server Startup:**
    *   `Debug mode: on`
    *   `WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.`
    *   `Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)`
    *   `Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`
    *   `Running on http://172.17.0.8:8000`
    *   `Press CTRL+C to quit`
    *   `Restarting with stat`
    *   `Debugger is active!`
    *   `Debugger PIN: 710-864-711`

2.  **HTTP Requests and Responses:**
    *   Lines with IP addresses (e.g., `172.17.0.1`) indicate HTTP requests.
    *   These lines show the date and time of the requests, the HTTP method (`POST`, `GET`), the requested URL or endpoint, and the HTTP status code (e.g., `500`, `404`).
    *   Examples of URLs:
        *   `/run?task=Say+Hello+Carlton`
        *   `/run?task=%0AInstall...` (appears to involve installing something)
        *   `/read?path=/data/format.md`
        *   `/run?task=Format+...`
        *   `/run?task=/data/datefile.txt...+has+list+of+dates...`
    *   HTTP status codes:
        *   `500` indicates a server-side error.
        *   `404` indicates that the requested resource was not found.

3.  **Python Traceback Errors:**
    *   The image includes Python traceback errors, providing information about where the errors occurred in the code.
    *   The tracebacks show the call stack, starting from the most recent call.
    *   Relevant file paths and line numbers are provided (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py`, `/usr/src/app/app.py`).
    *   One specific error message is: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'` in the file `/usr/src/app/app.py` on line 22, in the function `run_task`. This indicates that the variable `action` is `None` at this point, and it is trying to apply the `lower()` method to a `None` value.

**Interpretation:**

*   The server is running in a development environment with debugging enabled.
*   The application is receiving HTTP requests to various endpoints, including `/run` and `/read`.
*   Some requests are resulting in server-side errors (500), indicated by the Python tracebacks.
*   The `AttributeError` suggests a problem with how the application is handling the `action` variable, possibly when retrieving a classification.
*   Some requests for files (e.g., `/data/format.md`) are failing with a "Not Found" error (404).

**In summary:** The image displays the output from a running Flask web server, including server startup information, a series of HTTP requests, and error messages (tracebacks) indicating issues within the application's code, particularly with the `action` variable and file access.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Impression:** The image shows a log or error output, likely from a software application. It displays HTTP requests and associated responses, along with error messages and a score.

**Key Elements and Text Breakdown:**

1.  **Error Message (JSON-like):**
    *   `"error": "unable to open database file"`
    *   This suggests that the application is failing to access a database file.

2.  **HTTP Request (GET):**
    *   `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND"`
    *   This indicates that the application attempted to make an HTTP GET request to a local server running on port 8000. The URL requested was to read a file named `b10.csv` located in the `/data/` directory.
    *   The `"HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND"` response means that the server at `localhost:8000` could not find the requested resource (the `b10.csv` file at the specified path).

3.  **Error Message (Custom):**
    *   `B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv`
    *   This is another error message indicating the failure to read the CSV file.

4.  **Failure Indication:**
    *   `X B10 FAILED`
    *   This likely acts as a visual indicator of failure, with "X" marking that the task related to B10 did not complete successfully.

5.  **Score:**
    *   `Score: 12 / 20`
    *   This indicates that the application achieved a score of 12 out of a possible 20.

6.  **HTTP Request (POST):**
    *   `HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`
    *   This shows a successful HTTP POST request to an external service. The URL points to a service for generating embeddings, likely associated with OpenAI.
    *   The `"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"` response confirms that the request was processed successfully by the server.

**Interpretation:**

The application is experiencing an issue reading a local CSV file (`b10.csv`). This failure is resulting in a lower score. The application is also communicating with an external service for generating embeddings, and that part seems to be working correctly.

**Potential Issues:**

*   The `b10.csv` file might not exist at the specified location (`/data/b10.csv`).
*   The application might not have the necessary permissions to read the file.
*   The path in the HTTP request might be incorrect.
*   The local server might not be configured correctly.

@carlton  
My docker logs shows that `OSError: Cannot find resource` error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.  

image1485×807 37.4 KB

The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?  

image302×252 3.45 KB

  
I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.

So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .

Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.

Thank you
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a console output, likely from a Python program. It contains error messages (tracebacks) indicating a problem related to opening font resources. There's also some installation information and a URL encoded within a string.

**Key Text and Features:**

1.  **"Installed 3 packages in 42ms"**: Shows that some packages were successfully installed.

2.  **Tracebacks (Error Messages)**: There are two distinct tracebacks. Both point to an `OSError: cannot open resource`. The tracebacks indicate an issue within the PIL (Pillow) library related to opening or accessing font files.

    *   **First Traceback**:
        *   Starts within the file `/tmp/datagenmrt9km.py` at line 220, in a function called `a8_credit_card_image`.
        *   The error occurs when trying to load the font "arial.ttf" using `ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", size=60)`.
        *   The traceback continues through Pillow's internal functions (`ImageFont.py`, `freetype`).

    *   **Second Traceback**:
        *   Starts within the file `/tmp/datagenmrt9km.py` at line 303, in the module's main execution block `<module>`. It is calling the function `a8_credit_card_image()`.
        *   The error again occurs when trying to load a font file using `ImageFont.truetype()`, but this time it's trying to load `"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf"`.

3.  **OSError: cannot open resource**: This is the core error message. It means the program could not open the specified font file. This can be due to:

    *   File not found
    *   Insufficient permissions to access the file
    *   The file being corrupted

4.  **PIL/ImageFont.py**: Indicates the Pillow library's ImageFont module is involved in the error.

5.  **INFO:** The last line contains information about a POST request.
    *   `172.17.0.1:35176 - "POST /run?"`: Shows a POST request being made to `/run`.
    *   `task=%0AInstall+%60uv%60+%28if+required%29+and+run+the+script+%60https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fsanand0%2Ff19b6797f82b36da39ac4`: This is a URL-encoded string likely representing the task being executed. It includes instructions to install `uv` (likely a package manager) and run a script from a GitHub Gist URL.

**Possible Causes of the Error:**

*   **Missing Fonts**: The specified fonts ("arial.ttf" and "DejaVuSans.ttf") may not be installed or available in the specified locations on the system where the code is being run.
*   **Incorrect File Paths**: The paths to the font files might be incorrect.
*   **Permissions Issues**: The program might not have the necessary permissions to read the font files.
*   **Environment Issues**: If the program is running in a container (likely, given the `172.17.0.1` IP address often used in Docker), the container may not have the font files installed.

In summary, the image shows a Python program failing to load font files, likely due to missing fonts or incorrect file paths within the execution environment. The program is initiated via a POST request that attempts to install `uv` and run a script from a GitHub Gist.
 Here's a detailed description of the content in the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a list of function or method names, most likely from a programming context (possibly Python based on the naming convention). The list is vertically aligned and formatted in a way that suggests code or a table of contents.

**Specific Elements:**

*   **Function/Method Names:** Each line represents a function or method call. They all seem to follow a naming convention with an "a[number]\_" prefix, followed by a descriptive name indicating the purpose of the function.

    *   `a2_format_markdown()`: Likely formats text into Markdown.
    *   `a3_dates()`: Probably deals with date-related operations.
    *   `a4_contacts()`: Likely manages contact information.
    *   `a5_logs()`: Related to logging or recording events.
    *   `a6_docs()`: Associated with documentation or documents.
    *   `a7_email()`: Deals with email-related actions.
    *   `a8_credit_card_image()`: Possibly handles processing or displaying credit card images (handle with caution).
    *   `a9_comments()`: Deals with comments.
    *   `a10_ticket_sales()`: Pertains to ticket sales.
*   **Syntax:** The parentheses `()` after each name strongly suggest that these are function or method calls.

**Inferences and Context:**

*   **Purpose:** It appears to be a list of functional modules in a system or application, organized by the "a[number]" prefix perhaps according to an order of importance.
*   **Programming:** The names are suggestive of Python, but it could also be Javascript, or other scripting languages.

**Possible Questions the Image could help Answer:**

*   What are the functional modules of this software?
*   What does the a8 function do?
*   How are the different functions organized?

Let me know if you would like me to analyze a specific aspect or make further deductions.

image1505×276 16.1 KB

this is a 429 from sanand which is an error from your side. The evaluation already so delayed now has such issues because of which I am getting 1/20. @carlton @Jivraj
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**General Overview**

The image seems to be a screenshot of a process log or terminal output.  It shows a task being executed and encountering errors related to HTTP requests.

**Key Elements and their Interpretations**

1.  **Running Task:**
    *   Indicates a task is being performed.
    *   The task involves installing `uv` (likely a utility or library) if needed.
    *   It then runs a script from a GitHub Gist URL: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/f19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a/raw/13246698088795e1942179856aafd466052b66ae/datagen.py`

    *   The script is run with the argument: `23f3003196@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.

2.  **HTTP Request (Internal Server Error):**
    *   An HTTP POST request is made to `http://localhost:8503/run`.
    *   The request body (partially shown) contains URL-encoded parameters. It seems the `task` parameter is extremely long and includes information about the installation and the script being run.
    *   The server returns a `500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR`. This indicates a problem on the server side, not necessarily a problem with the request itself.

3.  **HTTP 500 Error (Too Many Requests):**
    *   This is a separate error, also an HTTP 500. It is contained in brackets.
    *   The `"error"` message reveals the specific issue:  "Agent error: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests".
    *   This means the agent making the request is exceeding the allowed rate limit for the URL: `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions`. This is likely related to OpenAI's API rate limits.

**Interpretation**

*   The image indicates that a script is being run, likely involving OpenAI.
*   The initial error is an internal server error, and then, the second error (429 "Too Many Requests") suggests that the code is making too many requests to OpenAI's API via the aiproxy.

**In summary, the image portrays a situation where a task attempts to use OpenAI's API, but encounters a rate limit error. The original Internal Server Error may or may not be related but could be causing repeated calls to OpenAI's API exacerbating the rate limit issue.**

When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.

In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.

But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.

We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.

Kind regards

Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between `pandas` and `numpy` caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (`pandas==2.0.3` and `numpy==1.24.3`) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (`santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest`). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!

Hi,

For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.

For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK

```
ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK


```

Similarly for task B2.

```
INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

```

For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.

For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?  
Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8

@Jivraj @carlton  
Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build

```
ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}

```

This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..

So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues..

Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help

Hello sir

I noticed that the log mentioned:  
“python: can’t open file ‘/app/app/main.py’: [Errno 2] No such file or directory.”

However, my main file was named run.py, which might have caused the issue. Since the code was present, I was given a 0. Would it be possible to run it again or consider partial marks for the submission?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate your help!

Hi @carlton @Jivraj

I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe\_open function that will throw a HTTP\_403\_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?

Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this

Dear sir, @carlton @Jivraj  
I got result as fail for the project 1 and the reasons listed are as in the screenshot. But as you can see in the second screenshot, i still have that repository which is public, have license file and docker file in it, created 2 months back. I actually don’t know how this issues come in, please resolve this.

The image shows a document describing the prerequisites for Project 1 and the evaluation results. 

The document lists the following requirements:
1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
2.  GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
3.  GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME.
5.  Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.

The Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations show:
*   Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
*   Github repo present AND public: FAIL
*   Dockerfile present in the root of the github repo: FAIL
*   MIT license present at the root of the github repo: FAIL

The final result is:
*   Prerequisites: FAIL
*   Project 1 Score: 0

The image is a screenshot of a document outlining project requirements and evaluation outcomes. The evaluation indicates failures in the GitHub repository's accessibility, presence of a Dockerfile, and the MIT license, leading to an overall failure in prerequisites and a project score of 0.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a GitHub repository's main page. It shows the repository's file structure, commit history, and general details.

**Top Section:**

*   **Repository Name:**  "tds\_proj1" which is marked as public.
*   **Branch Information:** The active branch is "main." There is "1 Branch" and "0 Tags."
*   **Navigation:**  There are "Pin" and "Unwatch" options. A search bar with the placeholder "Go to file" is present.
*   **Actions:** "Add file" is an option, and a green button labeled "Code" suggests actions related to viewing or downloading the codebase.

**Commit History and File List:**

*   **Commit Details:** A commit labeled "21f2000304" is described as an "update."  The commit hash is "5e4785c," made "2 months ago," and the repository has a total of "10 commits."

*   **File and Directory List:** The main part of the image presents a list of files and directories within the repository. Here's a breakdown:
    *   **Directories:**
        *   `_pycache_`
        *   `data`
        *   `env`
    *   **Files:**
        *   `Dockerfile`
        *   `LICENSE`
        *   `app.py`
        *   `datagen.py`
        *   `evaluate.py`
        *   `requirements.txt`
        *   `tasksA.py`

**General Details:**

*   Each file and directory entry is associated with the text "update" except the "LICENSE" file which reads "Create LICENSE".
*   "2 months ago" is displayed next to all of the files, indicating when the last changes were made to them.

**In summary, the image is a snapshot of a GitHub repository named "tds\_proj1," showing its file structure, recent commit history, and general settings.** The repository seems to contain Python-related code and configuration files, including a Dockerfile and a requirements file.

@carlton  
I have submitted my Project 1, and my GitHub repository meets all the listed requirements. However, I received a FAIL for the check:

“Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo?”

Despite this, my dockerfile is present in the root directory of my repository.

Github repo link: GitHub - karthiksirimilla/tds\_project1\_final

My evaluation.log , contains the score 6/20  
Roll no : 23f1002398

My evaluation.log  

IMG\_64181290×2619 566 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or console output. It shows a series of HTTP requests and their responses, along with error messages. The context seems to be related to a data processing or data analysis task, potentially involving a tool called "datasette" and a dataset named "ticket-sales".

**Key Textual Elements and Analysis:**

1.  **Top Information:**

    *   "23f1002398@ds.study.iitm.a..." This is likely a username or an identifier related to a user at "ds.study.iitm.a..." (which seems to be a domain for data science studies at IIT Madras).

2.  **HTTP Request Failures (Initial Errors):**

    *   "HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8309/read?path=/data/b9.html "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"" - This indicates a request to read a file "b9.html" from the "data" directory on the local host at port 8309. The response "404 Not Found" means the file does not exist at the specified location.
    *   "B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html" - Confirms that the process to read "b9.html" failed.
    *   "X B9 FAILED" - Further confirmation of the failure.

3.  **Datasette Task:**

    *   "Running task: Run datasette via 'uvx datasette /data/ticket-sales.db --port 8001' in the background. From 'tickets' count the number of rows where type is "Bronze" using http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(\*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type+=\%22Bronze\%22 and save it to /data/b10.csv. Then stop the datasette server." - This describes the core task:
        *   Run a datasette instance on port 8001, using the "ticket-sales.db" database.
        *   Execute an SQL query to count rows in the "tickets" table where the "type" column is "Bronze".
        *   Save the result to a file named "b10.csv" in the "data" directory.
        *   Finally, stop the datasette server.

4.  **HTTP Request (POST) and Error:**

    *   "HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8309/run?task=..." -  This seems to be a request to execute the above task.  The task details are encoded in the URL parameters.
    *   ""HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"" - The task submission resulted in a "Bad Request" error.
    *   **HTTP 400 Error Detail:** This section provides more detail about why the POST request failed:
        *   ""detail": "HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(\*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type=\%22Bronze\%22 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x76deb5efeb40>: Failed to establish a new connection: \[Errno 111] Connection refused'))"" - The primary reason is that the connection to the datasette server on `localhost:8001` could not be established. The error "Connection refused" suggests that either the server wasn't running or a firewall was blocking the connection. The SQL query itself is included within the detail, which might indicate a problem in encoding it or a related syntax issue.

5.  **Further Request Failures:**

    *   "HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8309/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"" - After the task execution failure, there's an attempt to read "b10.csv". It fails because the file wasn't created successfully in the earlier steps (due to the connection error).
    *   "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" and "X B10 FAILED" - Confirms that reading "b10.csv" failed.

6.  **Score:**

    *   "Score: 6 / 20" - Indicates a scoring metric related to the task, and the current score is 6 out of 20.

7.  **Final HTTP Request:**

    *   "HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"" - A successful POST request to an external API "aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings". This might be an unrelated part of the overall process, or a step that gets executed regardless of the failure of the datasette task. This appears to be accessing OpenAI's embedding service.

**In summary, the image shows a failed attempt to execute a datasette task because a connection to the datasette server at localhost:8001 could not be established. This resulted in errors when trying to read the expected output file.**

Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on the text and its implications:

**Overall Impression**

The image is a screenshot of an email. The email is a report on the prerequisite checks for a project (Project 1) submission, likely for a technical course or assignment.

**Key Textual Content**

*   **Subject:**  Project 1 Scores (inferred from top of image)

*   **Recipient:** "Dear Learner"

*   **Content:** The email outlines the prerequisites required to pass Project 1:

    1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    2.  GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
    3.  GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
    4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman.
    5.  Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository

    It mentions a link to "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page (likely a URL).

    The email states that failure to meet the minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.

*   **Prerequisite Evaluations:** The email lists specific checks and their results:

    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS"
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS"

*   **Final Result:**

    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL"
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0"

**Implications & Inferences**

*   **The Project's Nature:** The project involves using GitHub, Docker, and likely containerization technologies. The AIPROXY_TOKEN variable suggests dealing with environment variables and possibly remote access.

*   **Submission Status:** The learner has failed the prerequisites because the Dockerfile was not present in the root of the GitHub repository.  Therefore, the project is not eligible for evaluation, and the score is 0.

*   **Action Required:** The learner needs to add a Dockerfile to the root directory of their GitHub repository and ensure it is properly configured.

Let me know if you would like to know what the sender is!

Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.

However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.

Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.

The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.

But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.

Kind regards

There might be some glitches in the system. Could you kindly verify the process again?

10004306021080×2412 160 KB

I’ve already received my score in the evaluation log. Additionally, the Docker Hub run logs show no errors, and both the GitHub repo and Docker image are publicly accessible. All the content has been verified and meets the prerequisites.

Let me know if any further action is needed from my end.
Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Overall Image:** The image is a screenshot of an email displayed on a mobile phone.

**Email Header:**

*   **Sender:** 22t1 se2002
*   **Recipient:** "to me" (presumably the user who took the screenshot)
*   **Timestamp:** 01:25

**Email Body:**

*   **Greeting:** "Dear Learner,"
*   **Subject:** The email is about Project 1 and its prerequisites.
*   **Project Requirements:** The email lists several prerequisites that need to be met for Project 1, with reference to the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page". The prerequisites relate to a GitHub repository and a Docker image.
    *   The GitHub repository should be publicly accessible, contain a LICENSE file with the MIT license, and have a valid Dockerfile.
    *   The Docker image should be publicly accessible, runnable via a specific `podman run` command.
    *   The Docker image should use the same Dockerfile as the one in the GitHub repository.
*   **Evaluation Results:** The email provides an evaluation of the prerequisite checks:
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"
*   **Conclusion:** The email states "Prerequisites: FAIL" and "Project 1 Score: 0" indicating the project has failed the prerequisite checks.

**Phone UI:**

*   **Status Bar:** Shows the time (02:55), battery percentage (96%), and network/signal information.
*   **Navigation Buttons:** The standard Android navigation buttons (back, home, recent apps) are likely present (although not fully visible).
*   **App Icons:** There are app icons in the bottom portion of the screen. One of the icons shows a mail icon with "99+" suggesting there are more than 99 unread messages in the inbox.

**In summary:** The email informs the user that their submission for Project 1 has failed due to unmet prerequisites related to their GitHub repository (being publicly accessible, having a valid Dockerfile, having the MIT license). The Docker image appears to be passing checks.

Screenshot\_2025-04-01-08-51-01-349\_com.google.android.apps.docs1080×2340 219 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on textual and relevant features:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot from a terminal or a text-based interface on an Android phone. The primary content is code and output from running commands.

**Top Section (Email-like Header):**

*   `8:51 AM` is present, indicating the time.
*   The top center shows what seems to be a username: `23f2005702@ds.stud...` It seems to be an email or similar identifying string.

**Main Text Section (Instructions/Script):**

This section contains instructions and code snippets, suggesting a task or assignment related to data processing or server interaction. Here's a breakdown:

*   The text mentions "starting the server...". This indicates the context is about running a local server.
*   "Step 2: Count rows with SQL". This outlines the objective of counting rows in a database using SQL.
*   The instructions mention using `curl` to make a request to a URL that runs an SQL query. The code snippet provided suggests this:

    *   `bash` `curl "http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type=%22bronze%22" -o /data/b10.csv"`

    This command is likely making an HTTP request to `localhost:8001` to retrieve data from `ticket-sales.csv` using an SQL query. The result is saved to `/data/b10.csv`.
*   "Step 3: Stop the Dataset Server" indicates instructions on stopping the server process.
*   It outlines methods to stop the server, including using `kill` command with process ID.
*   "Additional Notes" suggests to ensure uvx and datasette are installed correctly on the system and to check if the `/data` directory is writable.

**Bottom Section (HTTP Requests and Errors):**

This section shows output related to HTTP requests and error messages:

*   `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8064/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"` This indicates that a GET request to `http://localhost:8064/read` with the parameter `path=/data/b10.csv` failed with a "404 Not Found" error, suggesting the server could not find the specified resource.
*   `B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv` This error suggests that the program or script was unable to read the file `/data/b10.csv`, which likely contains the SQL query result.
*   `Score: 10 / 20` indicates a grading or assessment score.
*   `HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"` This shows a successful POST request to an AI proxy server and a 200 OK response.

**Key Observations and Potential Problems:**

*   The "404 Not Found" error for `/data/b10.csv` implies that either the file was not created correctly or the server is not configured to serve files from the `/data` directory. This could be a permission issue, an incorrect path, or a server configuration problem.
*   The `B10 failed` message reinforces that the program is unable to access the file.
*   The overall context suggests a task involving running a local data server, querying a database, and accessing the results.

In summary, the image shows a student or user attempting to run a data-related task. They successfully made a request to an AI proxy server, but encountered problems when accessing the results from a local data processing task. The errors point to file access issues or server configuration problems.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or console output, likely from a programming or data science task. It shows a series of HTTP requests and error messages, suggesting issues with data processing, server communication, and API usage.

**Key Text and Information:**

*   **Email:** "23f2005702@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" is prominently displayed, potentially an email address associated with the user or process.
*   **Goal:**: The task at hand is to find all Bronze tickets, save them into /data/b10.csv, and then stop the data server.
*   **Data processing goal**: The task seems to involve querying a database (likely "ticket-sales.db") to find the number of "Bronze" type tickets. The result is intended to be saved to a file named "b10.csv" in the "/data" directory.
*   **HTTP Requests:**
    *   Several HTTP requests are made to "localhost" on different ports (8462, 8064). These are likely API calls to local services.
    *   A POST request is made to "https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings," which indicates usage of the OpenAI API for embeddings.
*   **Error Messages:**
    *   "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error" - A general server-side error, potentially related to data processing or querying.
    *   `"detail": "choices"` - The `choices` parameter has a problem.
    *   "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found" for "/data/b10.csv" - Indicates the file is not found at the specified path.
    *   "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" - Confirms the inability to access the data file.
    *   "HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests" - This error from the OpenAI API indicates the rate limit has been exceeded.
*   **Score**: 1/20
*   **Script URL**: The script running is hosted at: "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/f19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a/raw/1324669808879561942179856aafd466052b66ae/datagen.py". It's being run with the email address as an argument.
*   **"Install 'uv' (if required)":** This suggests the script may depend on the "uv" library.

**Interpretation:**

The image shows a debugging scenario where a script is attempting to:

1.  Query a database or data source related to "ticket-sales".
2.  Filter and count tickets of type "Bronze".
3.  Save the results to a CSV file.
4.  Potentially use OpenAI's embedding API.

However, the process is encountering several issues:

*   File access problems (cannot read the CSV file, potentially due to permissions or the file not being created correctly).
*   OpenAI API rate limiting (hitting the limit on requests).
*   A general server error related to the database query or data processing.
*   The `choices` parameters of a JSON object has a problem.

Respected Team,  
I received an email stating I failed to fulfil prerequisite and scored 0 because of it.  

Screenshot 2025-04-01 132313651×276 6.99 KB

  
I checked my Docker Hub and there it is showing “Public”  

Screenshot 2025-04-01 1319441479×124 7.78 KB

  
Can Anyone explain what I did wrong ?
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:** The image shows feedback on a project submission. It indicates that the submission failed to meet the minimum requirements and will not be evaluated.

*   **"Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS"** An MIT license file is located in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
*   **"Prerequisites: FAIL"** Overall, the prerequisites were not met.
*   **"Project 1 Score: 0"** The project received a score of 0.

**Implications:**

*   The primary reason for the failure is the Docker image not being correctly hosted on Docker Hub and made public.
*   The GitHub repository appears to be set up correctly, with the repository itself public, the Dockerfile present, and the MIT license in the root directory.

In summary, the image shows a failing grade on a project due to a missing or improperly configured Docker image on Docker Hub, despite the other requirements related to the GitHub repository being met.
 The image shows a table with the following columns: Name, Last Pushed, Contains, Visibility, and Scout. The table has one row with the following values:

- Name: coolsisters7/llm
- Last Pushed: about 1 month ago
- Contains: IMAGE
- Visibility: Public
- Scout: Inactive

Hi @Jayeshbansal ,

The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. `/jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3` docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.

It is the request to the team,to consider this since it is a problem of just a case letter otherwise the whole hardwork of doing the project will be wasted.  
Thank you

It depends where you tested it running, if it’s running inside a docker container and you feel there is problem with our script then you can debug our code and create a pull request on repo.

Hi @24ds2000125

You didn’t meet the standard naming convention for mit license naming. Name should be LICENSE(all caps) or LICENSE.md.  
check this out.

Hi @22f3001851

Standard naming convention for Dockerfile name was not followed we won’t be able to evaluate it.

My email is 22f3001642@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
@Jivraj Could you please check what’s wrong?
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a text-based report or evaluation, likely for a project or assignment.  It presents a series of checks with corresponding results, specifically:

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** FAIL (this line is circled in red)
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** PASS
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** PASS
*   **Prerequisites:** FAIL (also has a red line below it)
*   **Project 1 Score:** 0

There are also characters "?)" to the right of some of the lines.

The overall impression is that the project failed some initial checks related to Docker and general prerequisites but passed the checks related to the Github repository setup. The "Project 1 Score" being zero suggests that the project did not meet the minimum requirements or was incomplete.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a snippet from a table or list, likely within a software application or website. It displays information about items that were last pushed or updated.

**Columns:**

*   **Last Pushed:** Shows the time elapsed since the last update.
*   **Contains:** Indicates the type of content included in the item.
*   **Visibility:** Indicates whether the item is public or private.

**Rows:**

*   **Row 1:**
    *   Last Pushed: "about 2 hours ago"
    *   Contains: "IMAGE"
    *   Visibility: "Public" (This entry is circled in red)
*   **Row 2:**
    *   Last Pushed: "2 months ago"
    *   Contains: "IMAGE"
    *   Visibility: "Public"

**Other Features:**

*   There's an upward-pointing arrow next to "Last Pushed" suggesting that the list is currently sorted by this column in ascending order.
*   The text "IMAGE" is likely an indicator or tag showing that these contain pictures.

In summary, this excerpt of a table shows two repositories (or similar) that both contain Images. The first was updated about 2 hours ago, the second 2 months ago. Both are currently Public.

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh\_Saini any updates for the people like me whose image was run on the wrong architecture - mine was ARM ( was evaluated or ×86 ). I filled the form that was later sent for selecting the architecture.

I haven’t received any mail since then. But found many mails are sent to others in while.

Sir , I received the mail today regarding project 1 TDS scores and I have been marked fail because my repo is not public , and no docker file , no licence . but they all are present in my repo , and it is public too , , i am attaching the screenshot , you can see that too ,  
My email is 23f1000598@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
Could you please check what’s wrong?  
@Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini @carlton
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**General Layout:**

*   The image shows a GitHub repository interface. The user appears to be viewing the code repository named "tds-trail-1" under the username "Mayank8IITM".
*   The standard GitHub navigation bar is at the top, with options like "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," "Actions," etc.

**Repository Details:**

*   The repository is public, as indicated by the "Public" label next to the repository name.
*   The current branch is "main."
*   There is 1 branch and 0 tags in the repository.
*   There's a search bar labeled "Go to file" to find specific files.

**File Listing:**

The main part of the image displays a list of files and directories in the repository:

*   `__pycache__`
*   `data`
*   `.dockerignore`
*   `Dockerfile`
*   `LICENSE`
*   `README.md`
*   `datagen.py`
*   `evaluate.py`
*   `main.py`
*   `requirements.txt`

For each file or directory, the following information is shown:

*   The name of the file or directory.
*   A short description of the last change/commit affecting that file (e.g., "Project is done 7/10", "updated dockerfile", "Create LICENSE", "A2 and A9 left", "added dockerfile").
*   The time since the last change (e.g., "2 months ago").

**Commits:**

*   The repository has 10 commits in total.

**Actions:**

*   There is a green "Code" button and an "Add File" button visible near the top-right.
 Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image contains a text-based output that appears to be from a software evaluation or assessment system. It outlines the prerequisite evaluations for a project, specifically "Project 1". The output lists several checks and their corresponding "PASS" or "FAIL" status.

**Text and Content Breakdown:**

1.  **Header:** "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:"
    This indicates the section deals with the requirements that must be met before Project 1 can be properly evaluated.

2.  **Prerequisite Checks (Each line follows the format: "Is [condition] : [PASS/FAIL]")**
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
        This check verifies that a Docker image related to the project exists in Docker Hub and is publicly accessible.
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"
        This confirms if a Github repository for the project is available and public. It has failed this check.
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"
        This checks whether a "Dockerfile" (a configuration file for building Docker images) is located in the root directory of the Github repository. It failed this check.
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"
        This checks whether a valid MIT license file is located in the root of the GitHub repository, indicating proper licensing of the project. It failed this check.

3.  **Project Summary**
    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL"
        Overall evaluation, summarizing that the project did not meet all prerequisite requirements.
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0"
        Shows the project has earned 0 points.

**Overall Impression:**

The image displays the results of a series of automated checks conducted on a project to ensure it meets specific requirements. The project has failed in several checks, including Github Repo being present and public, Dockerfile, and MIT License being present in the root of the Github Repository, and therefore has a score of 0 and fails the prerequisites. The Docker image requirement has passed, however.

The task B6 was  
https://quotes.toscrape.com/ has quotes from famous people.  
The .author class has the quote author’s name.  
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.  
E.g. `["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]`

The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.

Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.

These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.

Kind regards

Hi Course Team,

I have also received an email today saying that my Project1 failed. But few days back I received an email with evaluation log saying I got 8/20. Which one is true?

10001125081080×1716 242 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image shows an email notification related to "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores". The email informs a learner about the results of pre-requisite checks for Project 1.

**Key Textual Elements:**

*   **Subject Line:** "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores"
*   **Sender:** The email is from "TDS Team."
*   **Recipient:** The email is addressed to "22t1 se2002."
*   **Body:**

    *   It explains that Project 1 requires passing pre-requisite checks.
    *   It provides a link to the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page.
    *   It lists the criteria for the pre-requisite checks:
        1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
        2.  GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
        3.  GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
        4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a `podman run` command.
        5.  Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.
    *   It states that if these requirements are not met, the submission will not be evaluated.
    *   The email then gives a status update on all pre-requisites:
        *   Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
        *   Is Github repo present AND public: PASS
        *   Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL
        *   Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS
    *   It summarizes the overall outcome: "Prerequisites: FAIL"
    *   Finally, the "Project 1 Score" is stated to be 0.
*   **Closing:** "Kind regards, TDS Team"

**Other Relevant Features:**

*   The email interface has typical email icons, such as reply and menu options.
*   The email indicates it was sent to the recipient directly ("to me").
*   The word "Inbox" appears near the subject line, further emphasizing that this is an email notification.

In summary, the image shows an email notification informing a learner that their Project 1 submission did not pass the pre-requisite checks and, as a result, received a score of 0. The learner failed specifically on a pre-requisite related to the presence of a Dockerfile.

image522×190 5.51 KB

my dockerfile is available in github, Please look into the issue  
Thank you
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

The image displays text related to project prerequisites. It seems to be a report or evaluation of whether certain criteria have been met for "Project 1."  The heading reads: "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:"

Beneath the heading are a series of statements, each assessing a specific requirement and indicating whether it passed or failed:

*   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
*   "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS"
*   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"
*   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS"

The text is written in a clear, straightforward manner, and the words "PASS" and "FAIL" are used to show the result of each prerequisite. The background appears to be dark, likely a terminal or code editor environment.

@carlton @Jivraj My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues.

This situation is particularly disheartening—**seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course.**

I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Kind regards

I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion. Is it possible for reevaluation. I have worked very hard and I don’t want to lose my marks because of some wrong id misconfusion. I request to check my dockerfile once again and provide the marks accordingly

Respected Sir,  
I have submitted my project following all the guidelines and fulfilling all the prerequisites. My docker file is available publicly and it is present in the root directory of github repo, still the mail says that the file is missing and my score is zero. Can you please look into this issue

image1145×334 7.28 KB
The image shows a list of files in what appears to be a file repository or code directory. Each entry includes the file name, a description or version, and the last modification date. Here's a breakdown:

*   **File Names:**
    *   `datagen.py`
    *   `dockerfile`
    *   `evaluate.py`
    *   `requirements.txt`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`

*   **Descriptions/Versions:**
    *   `datagen.py`: `v1`
    *   `dockerfile`: `docker updatae` (Likely a typo, perhaps meant "docker update")
    *   `evaluate.py`: `v1`
    *   `requirements.txt`: `v1.1`
    *   `tasksA.py`: `v1`
    *   `tasksB.py`: `v1`

*   **Last Modification Date:**
    *   All files were last modified "2 months ago."

The files suggest a software project that likely involves data generation (`datagen.py`), containerization (dockerfile), evaluation metrics (`evaluate.py`), dependency management (`requirements.txt`), and potentially tasks or functions split into two modules (`tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`). The file extensions (.py and .txt) indicate that it involves the programming language Python.

Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Overall Content:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an email related to a course or project evaluation. The email informs a "Learner" about the prerequisite checks for "Project 1". The message details the requirements and provides a status update on whether those requirements have been met.

**Textual Elements:**

*   **Header:** "22t1 se2002" and the time "1:27 am", likely the sender and timestamp of the email.
*   **Salutation:** "Dear Learner,"
*   **Introduction:** Explanation that Project 1 requires passing pre-requisite checks, details on the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page".

but in the email which i recieved i got the below thing , there is no information about the project score

my email without score1403×811 35.1 KB

sir could you please clarify about my project score ???  
waiting for the response
Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image contains a single, prominent element: a red "X" mark.
*   The "X" has a slightly glossy or shaded appearance, giving it a somewhat three-dimensional look.
*   The edges appear slightly rounded and soft, rather than sharp and angular.
*   The "X" is placed against a solid black background.

**Possible Interpretations:**

*   It could represent an "error" or "incorrect" symbol.
*   It could be a button used to close a window or dismiss a pop-up.
*   It could be a placeholder image indicating something is missing or unavailable.
*   The design style suggests a modern, possibly playful, or emoji-like aesthetic.
 Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be an email displayed in a standard email client interface. The email has a sender, recipient, subject, date/time stamp, and a main body of text. There are also standard email icons (like reply, forward, etc.).

**Header Information:**

*   **Sender:** "22t1 se2002"
*   **Recipient:** "to me"
*   **Date and Time:** "Mar 29, 2025, 12:17 AM (3 days ago)"

**Email Body Content:**

The email's main content is a feedback report regarding a "project 1 docker image submission." Here's a breakdown of the main points:

*   **Opening:** A salutation "Dear Learner," indicates this is a feedback email to a student or learner.
*   **General Feedback:** States the project was evaluated. "MISSING" means the evaluation didn't run or the docker image was misconfigured and result in a score of 0.
*   **Responsiveness Requirement:** The docker image needs to become responsive within 5 minutes.
*   **Hardware Details:** The images were run on an 8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit. The email notes performance wasn't a bottleneck, and each docker image had 1 Gigabit of network bandwidth.
*   **File Listing:**  A list of files related to the evaluation, with their status and brief descriptions:
    *   **Evaluation log file:** MISSING
    *   **Docker log file:** A Google Drive link is provided. `https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hrAjeGSjUOvpc6YNUj6WL8v5wKXK51W/view?usp=drivesdk`
    *   **Server start log file:** (See attachment, separate logs for arm vs x86)

**Important elements that are highlighted in yellow (I have marked them down below):**
* MISSING files will result in a **score** of 0.
* scoring
* These **scores** are not final but they indicate what our current evaluation standards will **score** you.
* necessary make amendments to your **score**.
* After which the **score** will be considered final.
* We will also look at the highest **scores** (including the **score** of the sample script we shared)
* the rest of the **scores**
* you with the **scores**.

**Key takeaways:**

*   This is automated feedback on a Docker image submission.
*   Some essential files are missing, indicating a potential setup issue.
*   The student has an opportunity to review and provide feedback on the evaluation.

Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of an email, likely from a grading system or evaluation platform. It's a message to a "Learner" providing feedback on their Project 1 docker image submission. The overall tone is informative, but also indicates that there were issues with the submission.

**Key Text and Information:**

*   **Sender:** "22t1 se2002", 3 days ago
*   **Recipient:** "to me"
*   **Subject:** (Implied: Feedback on Project 1 Docker Image Submission)
*   **Message Body:**
    *   **Introductory Remarks:** Acknowledges the evaluation of the Docker image submission.  States the message will detail the files that were checked.
    *   **Crucial Detail:** "**MISSING** indicates that the file is not available because the evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured." This highlights a problem.  It also offers an opportunity to contact the sender if the learner believes there's an error.
    *   **Consequence:** "MISSING files will result in a score of 0." Indicates a severe penalty for missing files.
    *   **Docker Image Requirements:** "Your docker image is supposed to become responsive in 5 minutes from launch." Specifies a performance requirement.  "If it does not, then we will not consider it." Indicates a pass/fail criterion.
    *   **Infrastructure Details:** Mentions the environment: "8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit" and "1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth." This emphasizes that resource limitations were not the issue.
    *   **List of Files and Their Status:** The message lists six specific files along with their purpose and status.

        1.  **Evaluation log file:** "MISSING" - "This contains your performance report on your individual tasks."
        2.  **Docker log file:** A Google Drive link is provided: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yWyBsDHHcV1-_nbfB5uZksMumimiHtzmG/view?usp=drivesdk`. Description: "This provides the technical performance of your container." The presence of the link suggests that this file was found and is available.
        3.  **Server start log file:** "(See attachment)." Description: "If your docker service did not start or respond to attempts to our requests."
        4.  **Evaluation script file:** "(See attachment)." Description: "This file has the actual tests that were run against your submission and the scoring mechanism."
        5.  **Data generation file:** "(See attachment)." Description: "The evaluation file depends on this file to create the data for the tasks."
        6.  **Docker orchestration file:** "(See attachment)." Description: "This file handles the retrieval of your docker image from..."

**Key takeaways**
*  The learner's submission has significant issues, especially regarding file availability
*  The email provides specific file names and locations
*  The email specifies performance criteria for the Docker image

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Given that you noticed an error on our side, you could have informed us about the same. However, you made your changes 22 hours ago, which is not acceptable.

```
tags = httpx.get(
                f"https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/{username}/{repo}/tags?ordering=last_updated",timeout = 60
            ).json()
            tag, size = next(
                (
                    (tag["name"], tag["full_size"])
                    for tag in tags.get("results", [])
                    if pd.Timestamp(tag["last_updated"]) <= DEADLINE
                ),
                (None, 0),

Sir,

The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.

image1145×673 33.8 KB

image633×336 7.1 KB

Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a GitHub repository's main page. It shows the file structure, commit history, and repository details. The dominant color scheme is dark, typical of GitHub's dark mode.

**Top Section:**

*   **Repository Name:** "tds\_project-1" is the name of the repository, marked as "Public".
*   **Actions/Options:** There's a "Pin" and "Unwatch" option on the right side.
*   **Branch Information:** Indicates the current branch is "main". It also shows "1 Branch" and "0 Tags."
*   **Search Bar:** A "Go to file" search bar allows users to find specific files within the repository.
*   **Add File:** An "Add file" button is present for adding new files or creating new files.
*   **Code Button:** A "Code" button allows users to download or access the repository code.

**Main File Listing:**

*   **Commit Details:** A commit labeled "22f3000585 Create LICENSE" is displayed. It shows the short commit hash "c61a6ef" and that it was committed "now". It also indicates that there are 6 Commits in the repo.
*   **File Structure:** The image then lists files and directories in the repository:
    *   `_pycache_` (directory) - "Final Submission" - "2 months ago"
    *   `venv` (directory) - "First submission" - "2 months ago"
    *   `Dockerfile` (file) - "First submission" - "2 months ago"
    *   `LICENSE` (file) - "Create LICENSE" - "now"
    *   `MIT LICENSE` (file) - "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE" - "2 months ago"
    *   `app.py` (file) - "Final Submission" - "2 months ago"
    *   `requirements.txt` (file) - "First submission" - "2 months ago"
    *   `test.txt` (file) - "First submission" - "2 months ago"
*   **File Metadata:**  For each file/directory, the description of the latest commit affecting that item is shown along with the time since the last modification.

**Key Observations:**

*   The repository appears to be a Python project based on the presence of `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `venv`.
*   A license has recently been added or updated (based on the "Create LICENSE" commit).
*   The project has a `Dockerfile`, indicating an effort to containerize the application.
 Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of some kind of evaluation or results page, likely from a course or project submission platform.  It presents a series of checks (prerequisites) for a project and indicates whether each has passed or failed.

**Text Content and Meaning:**

*   **"If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated."** This introductory line emphasizes the importance of fulfilling the listed prerequisites, indicating that failing to meet these requirements will result in the submission not being considered.
*   **"These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:"** This acts as a title for the section, clearly stating that the following checks are related to Project 1 and its prerequisites.
*   **"Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"** This is a check to ensure a Docker image is present in Dockerhub and is publicly accessible. It has passed, indicated by "PASS".
*   **"Is Github repo present AND public: PASS"** This ensures a GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible. This test also has passed.
*   **"Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS"** This checks for the presence of a Dockerfile in the root directory of the GitHub repository. It also has passed.
*   **"Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"** This checks for the presence of an MIT license at the root of the GitHub repository. This test has failed.
*   **"Prerequisites: FAIL"** This indicates that the overall prerequisite check has failed, likely because at least one of the individual prerequisite checks failed (in this case, the MIT license check).
*   **"Project 1 Score: 0"** This shows that the Project 1 score is zero, likely because the prerequisites were not fully met.

**Key Takeaways:**

The image shows that while the Docker image and GitHub repository presence and public accessibility passed, the MIT license check failed. This failure resulted in the overall prerequisites being marked as "FAIL" and the project receiving a score of 0. It's clear that the presence of the MIT license is a mandatory requirement for evaluation.

@Jivraj

Can you also clarify my issue?

My submission meets all the prerequisites according to my Git repository and Docker image. Additionally, I can see the results in the evaluation log.  
You can check the details in the images below. Screenshot of mail and repository

Roll no. : 21f3001076

GitHub Repo link

10004314101080×551 159 KB

10004314151079×1630 134 KB
The image shows the results of a Project 1 Prerequisite evaluation. 

The text "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:" appears at the top of the image, indicating the context of the information displayed. Below this title, a series of evaluations are presented, each stating a condition followed by a "PASS" or "FAIL" result.

The specific evaluations are:
1. "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS" - This means that the Docker image is successfully present in Docker Hub and publicly accessible.
2. "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL" - This indicates that the GitHub repository either doesn't exist or is not publicly accessible.
3. "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL" - This means that a Dockerfile is not found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
4. "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL" - This implies that an MIT license file is not found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

Finally, the image concludes with two overall results:
"Prerequisites: FAIL" - This overall assessment indicates that the prerequisites for the project have not been met.
"Project 1 Score: 0" - Reflecting the failure to meet the prerequisites, the project score is zero.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image is a screenshot of text, likely from a document or webpage. The text is formatted as a numbered list with links.

**Text Content:**

*   **Header:**
    *   Begins with the phrase "Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth available which is nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet."

*   **Numbered List:**

    1.  **Evaluation log file:**
        *   Followed by a Google Drive link: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AO\_ycjKpZCPzaiiEHqSMGBYGg/view?usp=drivesdk" (Parts of the link are obscured with red highlighting)
        *   Description: "This contains your performance report on your individual tasks."

    2.  **Docker log file:**
        *   Followed by another Google Drive link: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W3gD9x8woaemahTQdtx-ovkg3z9yL/view?usp=dak" (Parts of the link are obscured with red highlighting)
        *   Description: "This provides the technical performance of your container."

    3.  **Server start log file:**
        *   Description: "(separate logs for arm vs x86) (See attachment)."
        *   Additional information: "If your docker service did not start or respond to attempts to our"

**Objects/Features:**

*   **Google Drive Links:** The presence of the Google Drive links indicates that the log files are stored on Google Drive.
*   **Red Highlighting:** Some sections of the Google Drive links are obscured using red highlighting.
*   **Numbered List Formatting:** The use of a numbered list provides structure and indicates that these log files are likely provided as a set of related resources.

**Inferences:**

*   The text is likely instructions or information provided to a user after some kind of evaluation or technical process.
*   The user is likely expected to access the linked log files to analyze their performance or troubleshoot issues.
*   The mention of "arm vs x86" in the Server start log file suggests that the server could be running on different architectures.
* The text uses language geared towards the tech savvy.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot from a GitHub repository interface. It shows the main branch contents and a portion of the README file.

**Top Section:**

*   **Branch Selector:** A dropdown menu labeled "main," indicating the currently selected branch of the repository.
*   **Code Button:** A green button labeled "Code," which is likely used to access options related to cloning, downloading, or opening the repository in a code editor.

**File Listing:**

*   **Repository Owner/Contributor:** A profile icon and username "lakshay654" are displayed, along with a timestamp "2 months ago," which might indicate the last commit date.
*   **File Names and Dates:** A list of files and directories in the repository:
    *   Dockerfile (2 months ago)
    *   LICENSE (2 months ago)
    *   README.md (2 months ago)
    *   app.py (2 months ago)
    *   requirements.txt (2 months ago)
    *   task\_handler.py (2 months ago)
        *   Note that the dates "2 months ago" are likely indicating when these files were last modified or updated in the repository.

**Bottom Section (README Preview):**

*   **Tab Interface:** Tabs are visible labeled "README" and "MIT license".
*   **Project Title:** The beginning of the README content is displayed, starting with "TDS Project 1 - LLM-based".

**Key Features & Information:**

*   The repository contains files commonly associated with Python projects (e.g., `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `task_handler.py`).
*   The presence of a `Dockerfile` suggests the project might be containerized using Docker.
*   The README file indicates the project is titled "TDS Project 1" and is "LLM-based", implying it involves Large Language Models.
*   The repository includes a `LICENSE` file, and is licensed under the MIT license.

In essence, the image showcases the file structure of a GitHub repository related to an LLM-based project.

Standard name of dockerfile is Dockerfile that’s why it didn’t pass Dockerfile check

@Jivraj @carlton  
I understand sir Dockerfile name was misspelt sir. Since my Docker image was built and recognized, I didn’t realize this would prevent evaluation.  
I worked hard on this project sir, and my Docker image was built successfully. Please consider my submission sir.

I have been trying to resolve all the errors but just noticed that my docker image id associated with the project is “c9dc7fbcf405” , meanwhile the mail I received mentions that some other image id was evaluated.  
Can you please look into this matter and evaluate the correct Image ID.

@Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.

***However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.***

image1272×395 25.7 KB

But here’s the catch:\*\* Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:\*

* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models.
* Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.
* Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.
* Adding useful API endpoints, including an **`/api/`** multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing **`/read`** and **`/run`** endpoints from Project 1, plus a **`/clear`** endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.
* **Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP**, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.

All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like **hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents**, and it would do that for you—without **ever** declining the request. I like to think of it as a **terminal version of** OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent.

---

Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project **naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)** and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.

To clarify, **all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29**, **after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.** Furthermore, we were **never informed** that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My only request is that if my **updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated** due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my **original P1 eval score could be reinstated** instead of receiving a **0**—since it was already evaluated and graded.

Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a list of files or documents provided for an evaluation or project.  It includes file names, download links (for some), and brief descriptions of the contents.  The text is primarily in a standard font, likely sans-serif.  There is a concluding statement identifying a Docker image.

**Specific Content Items:**

1.  **Introduction:** There is a sentence mentioning "available which is nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet".

2.  **List of Files/Documents:**

    *   **1. Evaluation log file:**  A Google Drive link is provided: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GYe44D8gieDOlu9dCrKdsKwVAQ7i_C-N/view?usp=drivesdk`. The description states it contains a performance report on individual tasks.

    *   **2. Docker log file:**  Another Google Drive link: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VTVeD-lwg3CFPFUYAcUqNzaGD7MlzyeC/view?usp=drivesdk`. The description indicates it provides the technical performance of the container.

Actually I got the email as my docker file is not in root git hub repository. But everything thing looks fine and my docker file also runs well.. I want to check my repo again ..sir kindly do my my evaluation again and we have put lot of efforts doing this project 1 . Hope the team evaluated and gives the deserved marks  
@carlton  
@ TDS TEAM
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text and key features:

**Overall Context:**

The image is a screenshot from a mobile device, likely an email or notification. It displays the results of a prerequisite evaluation for a "Project 1" submission. The submission is not evaluated because the prerequisites have failed.

**Textual Content:**

*   **Header:**
    *   Time: 8:08
    *   Battery: 34%
*   **Main Content:**
    *   "submission will not get evaluated." - Important to indicate that the submission won't be assessed based on the current state.
    *   "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:" - Clearly states the purpose of the following information.
    *   **Evaluation Results:**
        *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS" - The Docker image is present and publicly accessible.
        *   "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS" - The GitHub repository exists and is public.
        *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL" - This is a critical failure. The Dockerfile is missing from the root directory of the Github repository.
        *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS" - The MIT license is correctly located in the root of the GitHub repository.
    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL" - A summary indicating the overall failure status due to the missing Dockerfile.
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0" -  The project receives a score of zero, likely due to the unmet prerequisites.
*   **Footer:**
    *   "Kind regards, TDS Team" - A closing message from the team responsible for the evaluation.

**Key Features/Observations:**

*   The most important point is the "Dockerfile" requirement being marked as "FAIL." This is preventing the project from being evaluated.
*   The image provides a clear and concise report of the prerequisite checks, making it easy to identify the problem.
*   The use of "PASS" and "FAIL" simplifies the result interpretation.

In summary, the image indicates a project submission failure because a Dockerfile is missing from the root directory of the GitHub repository, despite the presence of a Docker image on Docker Hub, a GitHub repository, and an MIT license.

There is no Dockerfile in the root directory of your GitHub repository. The standard naming convention for a Dockerfile is Dockerfile.

@carlton @Jivraj please let know if any issues in my end on the docker image not present issue.. As explained in earlier thread , the only reason docker image had to be pushed was the removal my office proxies in the docker image which was making the container not to startup from orchestration environment.. any help is appreciated..

Hi @thinkmachine @22f3002723

Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.

We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.

This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases

Thanks for the understanding @Jivraj

Hi @thinkmachine  
As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh\_Saini request your help in clarification for the same, the Github repo has been always present but it is marking it as fail. Thank you

---
A sigh of relief! Thank you so much for the heads up @Jivraj.

@Saransh\_Saini Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.

Once again, thank you both!

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh\_Saini

I am still uncertain as to why I received a second email regarding my project 1 score, indicating a failure due to unmet pre-requisites. I have inquired multiple times, yet I have not received a response. Meanwhile, several other posts, both before and after mine, have been addressed. Kindly clarify about that mail.

Thankyou

Hi @lakshaygarg654

Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.

We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.

We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.

Kind regards

@carlton @Jivraj  
Sir can you also see the case of Dockerfile name. Many students have named it dockerfile , lower case ‘d’ character instead of upper case.  
Please sir see through it

Thanks @carlton , for your response.

I was never worried about the result, whether it comes late or early. I know you will release it once everything is processed correctly. My concern was only about getting a response. Anyway, thanks for replying.

Also, today’s session has been canceled. I wanted to ask about the issue with editing responses in the Project 2 form. Is there any update on this?

Hi just wanted to know, there was no mail prior stating to keep the Dockerfile in the root folder of the repo (correct me if im wrong). Therefore i have put everything inside a folder - wont this be considered? Please clarify if possible.

Here is a detailed description of the content in the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a typical view of a GitHub repository page. It has a dark theme.

**Header Area:**

*   **Repository Name:** "tds\_project1" is the name of the repository. It is marked as "Public."
*   **Branch:** The current branch selected is "main".
*   **Branches and Tags:** Indicates that there is "1 Branch" and "0 Tags."
*   **File Search:** A search bar labeled "Go to file" is present.
*   **Add file** button
*   **Code Button**

**Main Content Area (File Listing):**

*   **Commit History:**
    *   The most recent commit has the ID "21f1002409" with the commit message "done".
    *   The commit hash is "4d2f5e5" and it was done "2 months ago."
    *   There are "14 Commits" in total.
*   **Folder:** A folder named "tds-project-1" is listed.
*   **Files:**
    *   "LICENSE" with the commit message "Initial commit"
    *   "README.md" with the commit message "readme changes"
    *   "README" with "MIT license"

**General Features:**

*   The overall appearance is clean and organized, following the standard GitHub layout.
*   The use of icons helps distinguish between files, folders, and other elements.
*   The timeline information ("2 months ago") provides context about when the files were last updated.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web interface, likely a code repository hosting service like GitHub or GitLab. It shows the file structure and history of a project.

**Top Section:**

*   **Project Path:** Displays the project name and path: "tds\_project1 / tds-project-1 /".
*   **Add File Button:** A button labeled "Add file" is present in the top right, suggesting functionality to upload or create new files within the repository.
*   **More Options:** Three dots indicate a dropdown menu for further settings and operations.

**Commit Information:**

*   **Commit ID and Message:** A line displays a commit ID ("21f1002409") and the commit message ("done").
*   **Commit Details:** Another line displays the SHA ("4d2f5e5"), age ("2 months ago"), and a link to the commit history.

**File Listing:**

*   **Headers:** A table-like structure shows column headers: "Name", "Last commit message", and "Last commit date".
*   **File/Directory Entries:**
    *   ".." (Double dots): This likely represents navigating to the parent directory.
    *   "app": A folder or directory named "app".
    *   ".gitignore": A file named ".gitignore".
    *   "Dockerfile": A file named "Dockerfile".
    *   "README.md": A file named "README.md".
*   **Commit Details:** Each file/directory has the commit message ("done") and the last commit date ("2 months ago").

**Visual Style:**

*   The theme is dark, indicating a dark mode interface.
*   Icons are used to visually distinguish files from directories.

**Key Observations:**

*   The project seems to have had a recent commit (2 months ago) that touched all the displayed files/directories.
*   The commit message for all entries is simply "done", which isn't very descriptive.
*   The repository likely contains a basic application structure, including Docker configuration, Git configuration, and a README file.

Can anyone explain what errors of this sort mean?
The image displays a JSON-formatted HTTP 500 error response.  The error message indicates a failure to get an LLM (Large Language Model) response after three attempts. The root cause is an authentication error with the specific error code 401, indicating the provided authentication token is not from a valid issuer.  Specifically, within the "details" field of the error response, it displays the error details and shows, message: "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer." type:'invalid_request_error', param: None, code: 'invalid_issuer'. The overall error message is "Internal server error".

You have to show which task triggered this error. Is it all of them or only one of them. Only then we can diagnose what the problem is.

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/224](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/224)

Here it is with the task, however the error doesn’t seem to be related to the task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be something wrong with the OpenAI API key. From the reading I did, it seems that the key was perhaps not set properly during evaluation? Not completely sure but please look into it.
Here's a breakdown of the image's content, focusing on the text and what it indicates:

**Overall:**

The image displays a console/terminal output indicating a failure during a task involving the formatting of a file using Prettier. It seems to be related to a local server and authentication issues.

**Key Elements and Interpretation:**

1.  **Task Initiation:**
    *   "`Running task: Format \`/data/format.md\` with \`prettier@3.4.2\` in-place`" This indicates that a task to format the file `/data/format.md` using Prettier version 3.4.2 was initiated, presumably in "in-place" mode (modifying the file directly).

2.  **HTTP POST Request and Error:**
    *   "`HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8365/run?...`"  A POST request was made to a local server at `localhost:8365` to execute a "run" task. The URL includes parameters indicating the file to format, the Prettier version, and "in-place" mode, though they're encoded.
    *   `"HTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR"`: The server responded with a 500 Internal Server Error, indicating an issue on the server-side while processing the request.

3.  **Detailed Error Information (HTTP 500 Body):**
    *   `"details": "Task handling error: Failed to get LLM response after 3 attempts: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}"`:  This section explains the cause of the 500 error. It states the task failed to retrieve an LLM (Large Language Model) response.  The error code 401 and the nested error message "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer." strongly suggest an authentication problem. It suggests that the application/service is attempting to use an LLM (likely for assistance in formatting or analysis), but its authentication token is invalid with the LLM provider.

4.  **HTTP GET Request and Error:**
    *   `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8365/read?path=/data/format.md "HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST"`: A GET request was made to `localhost:8365` to read the content of `/data/format.md`.
    *   `"HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST"`:  The server returned a 400 Bad Request error. This typically indicates a problem with the request itself (e.g., malformed URL, missing/invalid parameters).

5.  **Failure to Read File:**
    *   `A2 failed: Cannot read /data/format.md` The task "A2" (likely a component within the larger process) failed because it could not read the specified file (`/data/format.md`).

**In Summary:**

The error output suggests a problem related to:

*   **Authentication:** An invalid authentication token is preventing the service from using an LLM.
*   **File Access:** The system cannot read the file `/data/format.md`.
*   **Server-Side Error:**  The initial request to format the file resulted in an internal server error.

The root cause might be a misconfiguration of authentication credentials, incorrect file permissions, or a problem with the server-side task handling.

We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.

We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it **regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not** on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.

In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand

So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

@carlton Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.

I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.

Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.

Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**
The image is a screenshot of an email. The email is titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores" and is from a user named "22t1 se2002." The email's content pertains to prerequisites for a project, specifically, Project 1.

**Email Content Breakdown:**

*   **Salutation:** The email starts with "Dear Learner."

*   **Project Requirements:** It mentions that Project 1 requires passing some pre-requisite checks, details of which can be found on the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page (indicated as a hyperlink).

*   **Specific Prerequisites (Numbered List):**
    1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    2.  GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
    3.  GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
    4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`.
    5.  Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.

*   **Consequence:** Failure to meet these requirements means the submission will not be evaluated.

*   **Prerequisite Evaluations:** The email presents evaluations of the project's prerequisites:
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public": PASS
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public": FAIL
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo": FAIL

Same for me sir, i had everything correct still its showing:- Is Docker image present in dockerhub

AND is public: FAIL

I have submitted everything correctly . Please carefully look into this and recheck the project submitted.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of a text-based output, likely from a coding or project submission system. It presents the results of a prerequisite evaluation for "Project 1". The evaluation checks whether certain requirements have been met, and it appears the submission has failed the overall prerequisite check.

**Textual Elements:**

*   **Instructions/Explanations:** The text at the top mentions "podman run", Docker images, Dockerfiles, and GitHub repositories. This indicates that the project involves containerization (Docker) and version control (GitHub).

*   **Requirement:** Specifically, the line "Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository" highlights an important project requirement.

*   **Evaluation Results:** The core of the image displays a series of checks and their corresponding PASS or FAIL status:

    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL" - The Docker image is either not present on Docker Hub or is not publicly accessible.
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS" - The GitHub repository is present and publicly accessible.
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS" - A Dockerfile is present in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS" - An MIT license file is present in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

*   **Final Outcome:** The text "Prerequisites: FAIL" signifies that, due to at least one failing prerequisite, the overall evaluation failed.

*   **Project Score:** "Project 1 Score: 0" indicates that the project received a score of 0 because the prerequisites were not met.

**Objects/Formatting:**

*   The text is displayed in a monospaced font on a dark background.
*   The "PASS" and "FAIL" indicators are in a different color (presumably green for PASS and red for FAIL, although color is difficult to determine definitively from a text description).
*   The word "Dockerfile" is highlighted, which may indicate the importance of this specific file.

**In Summary:**

The image shows the evaluation results for a programming project submission. The key takeaways are:

1.  The project involves Docker and GitHub.
2.  The Docker image either does not exist on Docker Hub, is not public, or doesn't exist on dockerhub as a public image, causing the "Prerequisites" check to fail.
3.  A Dockerfile, a GitHub repository, and an MIT license are present in the correct locations.
4.  The project's score is 0 due to the failed prerequisites.

Sir,it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0  
@carlton Sir please look into this.

@carlton Sir, given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.
Here is a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overview:**

The image shows a snippet of text, likely output from a program evaluating project prerequisites. The overall context is likely related to software development and a project named "Project 1."

**Text Content Breakdown:**

*   **Lines leading up to prerequisites:**
    *   It mentions a Docker image and running it via `podman`.
    *   It emphasizes that the Docker image uses the same `Dockerfile` as the GitHub repository.
    *   It warns that failing to meet minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.
*   **Prerequisite Evaluations:**
    *   "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:" - Introduces the following evaluation results.
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL" - The Docker image is either not present in Docker Hub or not set to public accessibility.
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS" - The GitHub repository is present and public.
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS" - The `Dockerfile` is located in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: PASS" - An MIT license file is present in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
*   **Final Evaluation Summary:**
    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL" - Overall, the prerequisites have not been met.
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0" - Indicates that, due to the failure of prerequisites, the current score for Project 1 is 0.

**Inference:**

The student submitted a project that didn't meet the minimum requirement because the project's Docker image was either missing from Docker Hub or was set to private.

The Dockerfile, the Github repository itself, and the MIT license were all present and correct.

@carlton sir, similar thing happened to me as well, I had got the mail that git repo, dockerfile and lisence is not present or accessible while all the prerequisites are completed from my end. Can you please reevaluate my submission.

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Context:**

The image is an email or a notification related to a project submission, likely for a course or a technical assessment (TDS Project 1). The email informs the recipient that their submission has failed the preliminary evaluation checks.

**Key Text Sections:**

*   **Title:** "checks as detailed on the TDS Project 1: Evaluation page:" This indicates that the subsequent points refer to specific evaluation criteria.

*   **Evaluation Criteria (Numbered List):**
    *   1: GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    *   2: GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
    *   3: GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
    *   4: Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman with specific environment variables and port mapping.
    *   5: Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.

*   **Warning Message:** "If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated." This emphasizes the importance of meeting these criteria.

*   **Prerequisite Evaluations:**  This is the core of the message, outlining the results of the automated checks:
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"

*   **Result:**
    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL"
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0"

*   **Closing:**
    *   "Kind regards, TDS Team"

*   **Note:**  Advises the recipient not to reply to the email and to contact the course team via Discourse for assistance.

**Summary of Results:**

The Docker image part of the project is working, however the Github repo is missing the following three key elements: 
* The repo isn't publicly available.
* The repo does not contain a Dockerfile.
* The repo doesn't contain a MIT license.

**Overall Impression:** The image communicates a failure notification for a project submission due to missing or incorrect components in the GitHub repository. The Docker image part of the project passed, but the repo is missing important elements.

Hi Prashant,

Your prerequisites have passed and your evaluation is 6 tasks have been completed successfully. The email was auto sent because we were doing some checks with an older, stricter script. The newer script passes your evaluation.

Kind regards

Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.  
if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.

    *   "to me" - Indicates the email is addressed to the person who took the screenshot.

*   **Email Body:**
    *   "Dear Learner," - A formal salutation.
    *   "Project 1 requires you to pass some pre-requisite checks..." - Introduces the purpose of the email. It also refers to "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page" which is likely a hyperlink.
    *   A numbered list of 5 prerequisites:
        1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
        2.  GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
        3.  GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
        4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`. (This gives an example of a command-line execution.)
        5.  The Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.
    *   "If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated." - Emphasizes the importance of the prerequisites.
    *   "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:" - Introduces the evaluation results.
    *   A list of evaluation results (True/False statements):
        *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
        *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"
        *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"
        *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"
    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL" - Overall assessment of the prerequisites.
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0" - The score for Project 1 based on these prerequisites.

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Email App Interface:** It seems the screenshot is from a dark-themed email application (possibly Gmail on Android).
*   **Circular Avatar:** A purple circular avatar on the top left with the number "2" inside of it.
*   **Arrow Icon:** On the top right, there is a back arrow icon and a 3 dots icon for more options.

**In Summary:**

The image is a negative feedback email regarding Project 1 prerequisites. The student passed the Docker image requirement but failed the requirements related to their GitHub repository. As a result, they received a score of 0.

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a relatively new GitHub repository for a project related to large language models (LLMs) and presumably some kind of data science (TDS). The repository contains Python code and a Dockerfile, indicating it's likely a Python-based application that is designed to be containerized. The repository is in its initial stages, with mostly initial commits. The project has not yet been widely adopted (no stars or forks).

This was your submission and we could not locate a docker repo against it.

image1885×918 92 KB
Here's a breakdown of the content in the image:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image shows a section of a code repository interface, possibly from a platform like GitHub or GitLab. It seems to be displaying data in a table format.

**Top Section:**

*   **Tabs:** "Preview", "Code", and "Blame" tabs are visible. The "Preview" tab appears to be selected.
*   **File Information:** "1069 lines (1069 loc) - 127 KB" indicates the size and line count of the file being viewed.
*   **Search Bar:** A search bar with a magnifying glass icon is present, suggesting the ability to search within the content. The search term entered is "23f1000057@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
*   **Actions:** Various icons on the right side, like "Raw", "Copy", and "Download", suggest actions that can be performed on the file (view raw code, copy content, download).

**Table Section:**

*   **Headers:** The table has the following column headers:
    *   "Timestamp"
    *   "Email Address"
    *   "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?"
    *   "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?"
*   **Data Row:** A data row with the following information:
    *   Row number: 669
    *   Timestamp: "2/16/2025 20:39:53"
    *   Email Address: "23f1000057@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
    *   GitHub Repository Link: "https://github.com/Vedant22042004/project"
    *   DockerHub Image Name: "vedant22042004/project"

**In essence, the image is displaying data related to a code project, including the email of the person who contributed it, a link to their GitHub repository, and the name of the DockerHub image associated with the project.**
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a Docker Hub webpage displaying an error message.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Docker Hub Interface:** The top portion of the image shows the Docker Hub interface, including the logo, "Explore" and "My Hub" tabs, a search bar ("Search Docker Hub"), and user account information (identified by the letter "J").
*   **URL:** The URL in the address bar is "https://hub.docker.com/r/vedant2204/project/tags".
*   **Navigation:** Underneath the main navigation, there's a breadcrumb navigation: "Explore / vedant2204 / project", suggesting the user was trying to access a specific project page within the vedant2204 user namespace.
*   **Error Message:** The central focus is a large blue circle containing the error message:
    *   **"404"**: This is the HTTP status code indicating the resource (page) was not found.
    *   **"Oops!"**: A friendly way to acknowledge the error.
    *   **"The page you have requested was not found"**: A clear explanation of the error.
*   **Visual Element:** Below the error message is a cartoon-like image of a person peering out from behind a computer screen, further emphasizing the "not found" message.

**Text Analysis:**

*   The text "vedant2204" is present in the URL and breadcrumb navigation, suggesting it's a username or account name on Docker Hub.
*   "project" and "tags" in the URL indicate the user was trying to access the tags associated with a specific project.

**In summary, the image shows a 404 error page on Docker Hub, indicating that the specific project or resource (likely related to user "vedant2204") the user was trying to access could not be found.**

If you used openai’s python module then you were needed to pass your own api key, hardcode it in code.

API key that we were sending was only valid through proxy server created by professor anand.

but my evaluation log file was missing… so that would make it a 0 right..I have accepted my fate that it would be a 0 but just a lil hope
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image features a yellow, melting smiley face emoji.

*   **Emoji Shape:** The overall shape is that of a typical smiley face (round) but with the bottom section appearing to melt or drip downwards.
*   **Color:** The emoji is a bright, sunny yellow color.
*   **Facial Features:** It has simple, cartoonish facial features:
    *   Two dark brown, slightly oval-shaped eyes.
    *   A curved, dark brown line forming a simple smile.
*   **Melting Effect:** The bottom edge of the emoji has a "melting" effect with drips or globules of yellow extending downwards.

**Overall Impression:**

The image conveys a sense of silliness, absurdity, or perhaps even a slightly unsettling feeling due to the melting effect combined with the happy face. It could be interpreted in various ways depending on context.

We are rebuilding all docker submissions from github commit before 18th of Feb, using your Dockerfile manifest present in the repo.

That way there is no architecture issues.

Its part of our secondary check. And more students have gotten scores in this check. So dont worry.

@carlton @Jivraj  
I recently received an email with an evaluation file for Project 1, which included a score. However, in the recent email, I noticed that my score was recorded as zero, despite fulfilling all the prerequisites.  
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my project, as I believe this may be an error.

@Jivraj @carlton  
Sir,  
In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.

Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 10.31.02 AM1358×906 47.7 KB

This is my Github repo:

Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 10.44.24 AM3324×1794 497 KB

I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?

After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.
The image shows the output of a Python program, which includes the installation of several packages and a traceback due to a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Package Installation:**

*   The output starts with the building of several packages: `antiorm==1.2.1`, `db==0.1.1`, and `db-sqlite3==0.0.1`.
*   Then, the image shows the downloading of several packages along with their sizes: `scipy` (35.6MiB), `pandas` (12.1MiB), `numpy` (15.4MiB), `pydantic-core` (1.9MiB), and `duckdb` (19.3MiB).
*   The output then indicates that `pydantic-core`, `antiorm`, `db`, `db-sqlite3`, `numpy`, `duckdb`, `pandas`, and `scipy` were downloaded and built.
*   Finally, it states that "Installed 33 packages in 56ms".

**Traceback and Error:**

*   After the package installation, a traceback is displayed.
*   It points to the file `/app/app.py`, specifically line 22, within the `<module>` scope.
*   The error is a `ModuleNotFoundError`, with the message "No module named 'tasksA'". This indicates that the Python program is trying to import a module named `tasksA`, but it cannot be found.

In essence, the image shows a Python environment where several packages were successfully installed, but the program then encountered an error because it couldn't find a module named `tasksA`.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on textual information and key elements:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image shows a GitHub repository interface.

**Top Navigation Bar:**

*   **Left:** "GaURaVinDeX / tds-project1" (Likely the username and repository name)
*   **Center:** "Code", "Issues", "Pull requests", "Actions", "Projects", "Wiki", "Security", "Insights", "Settings" (Navigation links)
*   **Right:** A search bar with placeholder text "Type to search"

**Repository Information:**

*   "tds-project1" (Repository Name), "Public" (Repository visibility).
*   "main" (Branch Name), "1 Branch", "0 Tags"
*   "Go to file" search bar.
*   "Add file" dropdown, "<> Code" (Green button, likely indicating code viewing)

**File Listing:**

A list of files and directories is displayed, along with their last commit message and age:

*   "GaURaVinDeX Initial commit"
*   ".\_\_pycache\_\_ Initial commit 2 months ago"
*   ".gitignore Initial commit 2 months ago"
*   "Dockerfile Initial commit 2 months ago"
*   "LICENSE Initial commit 2 months ago"
*   "app.py Initial commit 2 months ago"
*   "requirements.txt Initial commit 2 months ago"
*   "tasksA.py Initial commit 2 months ago"
*   "tasksB.py Initial commit 2 months ago"

**README and License:**

*   Tabs for "README" and "MIT license" are visible below the file list.
*   A placeholder message "Add a README" is displayed with the text "Help people interested in this repository understand your project by adding a README."
*   Button labeled "Add a README"

**Right Sidebar (About Section):**

*   "About" title
*   "No description, website, or topics provided."
*   "MIT license"
*   "Activity"
*   "0 stars"
*   "1 watching"
*   "0 forks"
*   "Releases" section with text "No releases published", and "Create a new release" link.
*   "Packages" section with text "No packages published" and a "Publish your first package" link.
*   "Languages" section with:
    *   "Python 98.0%"
    *   "Dockerfile 2.0%"
*   "Suggested workflows" section:
    *   "Python package"

**Key Observations:**

*   The repository seems to be new or recently initialized, as all listed files have the "Initial commit" message and are "2 months ago".
*   The repository is set to Public.
*   The project uses Python with a Dockerfile.
*   A README is currently missing.

This is a common mistake many, many students made. They created a working application but not a working container.

Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 11.13.32 am2116×1512 323 KB

  
You only copied `app.py` into your docker image.

How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?

Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

Kind regards
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository page, specifically showing the contents of a file named "Dockerfile".  The repository appears to be named "tds-project1" and belongs to the user "GaURaVinDeX".

**Top Navigation Bar:**

The top navigation bar shows typical GitHub options:
*   Code
*   Issues
*   Pull requests
*   Actions
*   Projects
*   Security

*   `LICENSE`
*   `app.py`
*   `requirements.txt`
*   `tasksA.py`
*   `tasksB.py`

**Dockerfile Content:**

The right side displays the content of the "Dockerfile".  The Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image.  Here's a breakdown of the key lines:

*   `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm`:  Specifies the base image as Python 3.12 slim-bookworm.

@thinkmachine

Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief.

*However* with regards to your long post…

Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a *very* experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.

What you have done is what is called in industry as **gold plating**. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.

In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?

1. Because it does not deliver what was required,
2. Wastes valuable time and resources
3. Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)
4. Complicates testing
5. Leads to scope creep

His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.

I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.

For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

Kindest regards
Here's a detailed description of the image:

*   **Subject:** The image depicts a simple, yellow smiley face emoji.
*   **Facial Features:** The emoji has two round, brown eyes and a curved, closed-mouth smile. The smile is a simple, upward-curving line.
*   **Shape and Color:** The face is a round, yellow circle. The color is a solid, bright yellow with some gradient shading to give it a slight 3D appearance.
*   **Background:** The background is black, providing a strong contrast that makes the smiley face stand out.
*   **Style:** The emoji is rendered in a simple, flat style typical of digital emoji.
*   **Overall Impression:** The image conveys a sense of happiness, friendliness, and positivity.

Hi Sir,  
I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1” instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is **4db729a03f74** , which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available.  
I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your positive response.  
@carlton @Jivraj

Hi Abhay,

This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.

Kind regards

Hi sir, hope you are doing well.  
Could you please check and let me know if I have passed the project 1 and if yes then how much am I scoring in Project 1 after the latest evaluation?  
@carlton

Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton. It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.

Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible **within the scope of the problem statement**.

What began as just another (pun intended) *tedious* assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents.

*(…caution: long post ahead )*

I noticed that **test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use**. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the **inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads**. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.

Some might suggest using `temperature=0` to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.

**Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers**: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.

At the core of it, it’s all about **how much flexibility vs rigidity** we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.

Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,

* Reason about the task, understand intent,
* Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. *design* a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)
* Execute those workflows (*walk* the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.
* Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.

Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.

To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of **general-purpose tools**:

* A REPL executor (for quick calcs)
* A Python script runner
* A Shell executor

With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.

As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was **emergent behavior**, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. *Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!*

I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. **Food for thought! Really!**

As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.

PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: **thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design**. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride.

---

**TL;DR**  
My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

Kind regards
Certainly! Let's analyze the image you sent.

**Content:**

The image displays a single object:

*   **A Yellow Emoji:** The primary element is a round, yellow emoji. It's a smiling face with closed eyes, a wide-open mouth, and visible teeth. The inside of the mouth appears pink, while the eye shapes and the area behind the teeth are a darker shade, seemingly brown. The face has a cheerful and joyous expression.

There is no visible text in the image. The background appears to be a solid black color, isolating the emoji as the sole subject.

Based on the expression, this emoji is likely intended to convey happiness, joy, amusement, or laughter.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:** The image is of an emoji. Specifically, it's a yellow smiley face with a wide, open mouth, showing teeth. The eyes are closed in a squinting manner, conveying amusement. A single blue droplet of sweat is present on the forehead, typically used to suggest relief, embarrassment, or nervous laughter.

**Key Features:**

*   **Yellow Face:** The emoji's base color is a bright, typical yellow.
*   **Smiling Mouth:** A large, open mouth with visible teeth indicates a strong smile or laugh.
*   **Closed Eyes:** The eyes are closed and somewhat squinting, reinforcing the idea of laughter.
*   **Sweat Droplet:** The blue sweat droplet is a crucial element, suggesting relief after a stressful situation, or awkwardness.

In summary, the emoji communicates a feeling of relief or awkward amusement. It’s often used when something stressful turns out okay, or to express discomfort in a humorous way.
 Here's a detailed description of the content of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a single emoji on a black background. The emoji is a yellow face with a wide, open mouth, indicating laughter.

**Key Features:**

*   **Emoji Type:** The emoji appears to be a "Grinning Face with Big Eyes" or a similar representation of hearty laughter. The wide open mouth shows the upper teeth and a pink tongue.
*   **Color:** The face is primarily yellow. The inside of the mouth is a darker shade of brown or black, and the tongue is pink.
*   **Facial Features:** The eyes are wide and expressive, conveying joy and amusement.
*   **Background:** The background is solid black, which makes the bright yellow emoji stand out.
*   **Resolution:** The image appears to be of relatively low resolution (pixelated), as visible on the edges of the circle and facial features.

**Potential Interpretations:**

The emoji generally conveys happiness, amusement, joy, or laughter. It is a positive and expressive emoji.

Hello Sir,

Screenshot\_2025-04-05-18-51-43-721\_com.google.android.gm1080×2400 144 KB

I got this mail regarding my project 1 scores. My github repo is present and public as well as MIT License and Dockerfile is also present at the root of the repo

github.com

### GitHub - SrishtySnehi/Project\_1\_tds

Contribute to SrishtySnehi/Project\_1\_tds development by creating an account on GitHub.
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Content Overview:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an email or a notification from a system related to a project submission. The email is likely an automated response indicating whether the project meets the required prerequisites.

**Key Textual Elements:**

*   **Subject:** Based on the content, the email likely concerns the evaluation of prerequisites for "Project 1."
*   **Sender:** The email is from "TDS Team."
*   **Prerequisites Evaluation:**
    *   The email outlines several requirements for the project.
    *   It then lists specific checks and their results. These checks seem to be automated.
*   **Evaluation Results:**
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS" - Indicates the Docker image is successfully present and publicly accessible.
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL" - Indicates the GitHub repository is either missing or is not publicly accessible.
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL" - Indicates the Dockerfile is not found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL" - Indicates the MIT license file is not found in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
*   **Overall Status:**
    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL" - This means the project does not meet all the necessary prerequisites.
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0" - The project receives a score of 0, likely due to failing the prerequisites.
*   **Other important details:**
    *   The email outlines 5 requirements for project 1 submissions.
    *   The fourth requirement includes a docker image being run by the following command: `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

**Implications:**

The email indicates that the student has successfully made their Docker image publicly available on Docker Hub. However, they are failing to meet the Github repository's requirements. The issues are:

1.  The GitHub repository is not present or is not publicly accessible.
2.  The Dockerfile is not in the root directory of the GitHub repository.
3.  The MIT License file is not in the root directory of the GitHub repository.

The project cannot be evaluated with the given status, and the student must correct the issues with their GitHub repository.
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a GitHub repository interface.

**Main Title:** The repository is named "SrishtySnehi/Project_1_tds."

**Repository Icon:** To the right of the repository name, there is an icon. The icon appears to be a simplified representation of a plus sign symbol, rendered in a muted pink color. It's placed on a light gray rounded square background.

**Repository Statistics:** Below the main title, there are several statistics related to the repository:

*   **Contributors:** 1 contributor
*   **Issues:** 0 issues
*   **Stars:** 0 stars
*   **Forks:** 0 forks

**GitHub Icon:** At the bottom right corner, there is the GitHub logo.

In summary, the image presents a GitHub repository with a specific name, an icon, and the usual metrics for contributions, issues, stars, and forks.

Also really great how yall have given the error logs for everyone individually
Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a single emoji. The emoji is a bright yellow face with its eyes tightly closed. Large, bright blue tears are streaming down its face in two thick streams. The mouth is slightly open, showing a beige interior. The eyebrows are arched upwards, contributing to the overall expression of intense sadness or crying.

In short, the image is a "Loudly Crying Face" emoji.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a yellow emoji with the following features:

*   **Color:** The emoji has a bright yellow skin tone.
*   **Facial Features:** It has two round, brown eyes and a simple, slightly smiling mouth.
*   **Hand Gesture:** A small, stylized hand is positioned at the forehead in a salute-like gesture. The hand is also yellow, matching the skin tone of the emoji.

**Overall Impression:**

The emoji appears to be conveying a gesture of salutation, respect, or perhaps even a "facepalm" type of frustration depending on the context.

@carlton @Jivraj in earlier evaluation of P1 in that my B1 is passed but in this final scores email it is showing as 0 for B1 pls help  
  

b1passed1109×141 12.2 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a snippet of what appears to be a spreadsheet or table. 

*   **Top Cell:** The top cell contains the text "B1". This indicates that it is likely the cell located in column B and row 1 of the spreadsheet.
*   **Bottom Cell:** The cell directly below contains the numerical value "0".
*   **Format:** Both cells are displayed within a grid, suggesting a spreadsheet format.

In summary, the image displays a section of a table or spreadsheet where cell B1 is labeled and the cell directly below it contains the value 0.
 Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**1. Status Indicators:**
   - **"B1 PASSED":** A green checkmark symbol next to this text indicates that a process or test named "B1" has successfully passed.
   - **Running task:** A yellow dot and the text `Running task: Delete /data/format.md` indicate that a task named `Delete /data/format.md` is currently running.

**2. HTTP Request:**
   - The text `HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8325/run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"` shows an HTTP request:
     - **POST:** The request method is "POST".
     - **URL:** The request is being sent to `http://localhost:8325/run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md`. It appears to be targeting a local server on port 8325 and passing a task parameter. The `%2F` is URL encoding for a forward slash.

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All Required Files

Dear @Carlton sir  
I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.

* My GitHub repository was **public** at the time of submission.
* I had included the **Dockerfile** as required.
* I also added the **MIT License** to the project.
* For your reference, I am also attaching a **snapshot** of the repository as it was during the submission time.

Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a **concrete reason** for giving **zero marks**. I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence .  

emailsnapshotfor\_discourse1785×957 130 KB

  

repo\_snapshotforDiscourse1842×968 84.4 KB

  
please just check my repo manually and clarify whether it was public or not . What is going on this degree .
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image captures a screenshot of a Gmail inbox.
*   The Gmail interface is visible, showing the left-hand navigation menu (Compose, Inbox, Starred, Snoozed, Sent, Drafts, More, Labels), the search bar at the top, and the email content in the main central area.
*   At the top right are controls related to the Gmail account and settings.

**Email Content:**

*   The main focus is on the content of an email. This email appears to be related to project/task grading or assessment.
*   Key elements of the email content include:
    *   **Instructions:** Instructions for marks for tasks completed.
    *   **Total Score:** The total score is out of 20.
    *   **Normalization:** Task scores are normalized to 20 based on the highest score in Project 1 which is 16.
    *   **Bonus:** A bonus is awarded for the number of commits and repo size.
    *   **Final Score:** Formula for final score calculation as MIN (20, (task score + bonus)).
    *   **Repository Submissions:** Links or mentions of submitted repositories on GitHub and Docker. It provides the GitHub repo and Docker repo links.
    *   **Pre-requisites Check:** There are checks performed, possibly automatically, with Pass/Fail indicators (1 for Pass, 0 for Fail). These include checks for Docker repo existence and public accessibility (with a timestamp before 18th of Feb), GitHub repo existence and public accessibility (with a timestamp before 18th of Feb), GitHub repo having a LICENSE file (MIT License), and GitHub repo having a Dockerfile.
    *   **Task Score Table:** A table (likely HTML-based) showing scores for various tasks A1 through A10, B1 through B10, and implicitly, C1 through C5. The current scores appear to be zeros across all tasks shown in the table.

**Specific Text and Information:**

*   "You will get 1 mark for each task completed. A1-A10, B1-B10, C1-C5"
*   "C1-C5 are bonus tasks"
*   "Your total score is out of 20."
*   "Github repo submitted: [GitHub URL]"
*   "Docker repo submitted: [Docker URL]"
*   "Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)"
*   "Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1"
*   "Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 0"
*   "Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 0"
*   "Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0"
*   Columns A1 - A10 and B1 - B10 all have score values of '0'.

**Overall Impression:**

The image likely shows an automated grading system result or feedback email for a coding project. It details the scoring criteria, lists the submitted repositories, provides pre-requisite checks, and displays the task scores.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:** The image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository page.

Hi sir  
I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.

During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change.  
Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir  
Thank you

Dear @carlton Sir,

I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks.

The image shows a snippet of text and icons likely from a software or application interface. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Top Line:** There's a red "X" icon followed by the text "B10 FAILED." This suggests an error or unsuccessful operation.

*   **Middle Line:** There's a target icon (red and yellow target with a blue dart) followed by the text "Score: 8 / 20". This indicates a scoring system, and the current score is 8 out of a possible 20.

*   **Bottom Line:** "HTTP Request: POST https://aipro..." The text indicates an HTTP POST request being made to a URL that starts with "https://aipro...". The URL is likely truncated.

Respected sir,  
I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn’t evaluated due to port error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not to be evaluated only.

Dear @carlton Sir,  
I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.  
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.  
Thank you.

Respected Sir,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.

According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.

Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

@carlton i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds a significant amount of weightage in the end term  
I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did  
Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.

@carlton sir When I submitted project 1, I was passing part A with 8/10 marks but today it is showing 0 marks on my email, but when I run it just now it is showing 4/10 on my vs code.  
Whereas when I download the file from GitHub and run it, it is showing 1/10 now.

Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on the text and relevant features:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE window. The window is divided into three main sections:

1.  **Explorer (Left):** This panel displays the file directory structure of the "LLM Automation Agent-main" project. Files such as `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py` are listed. A folder named "data" and an ".env" file are also present.
2.  **Editor (Middle):**  The file `app.py` is open in the editor. The code appears to be a Python script with dependency declarations (requests, fastapi, uvicorn, python-dateutil, and pandas).
3.  **Terminal (Bottom):** This panel shows the output of a program. It displays HTTP responses and related messages.

**Key Textual Information in the Terminal:**

*   **"A10 Task..."**:  The terminal output indicates that it's related to "A10 Task" and interacts with a SQLite database file located at `/data/ticket-sales.db`.
*   **Task Description:** The task requires calculating the total sales of "Gold" ticket types. It appears to read data from the file `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`.
*   **HTTP Responses:** The terminal displays HTTP 200 OK responses, including the request URL `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`.
*   **EXPECTED vs. RESULT:** The output shows that the expected result for the task (177250.79) does not match the actual result (200401.84). This indicates that the task failed.
*   **"A10 FAILED"**: Explicit confirmation that A10 Failed.
*   **Score:** The overall score is 1/10.

**Code in `app.py`:**

The code snippet in `app.py` indicates that it's a Python script using dependencies like "requests", "fastapi", "uvicorn", "python-dateutil", and "pandas". These are likely used for handling HTTP requests, creating a web API (FastAPI), running a web server (Uvicorn), and processing data.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image captures a debugging session. The "LLM Automation Agent" is attempting to perform a task (A10), which involves querying a SQLite database for ticket sales data and calculating a total. The expected result does not match the actual result produced by the system, causing the task to fail.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on text and key features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a laptop screen displaying a code editor (likely VS Code) with a Python project open. There are several files in the project, including `app.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`, `dockerfile`, `env`, and `datagen.py`.  The "TERMINAL" tab is selected, showing output from a program execution, including a test failure.

**Code Editor Details:**

*   **File Structure:** The explorer panel on the left lists the project's files and directories.
*   **`app.py` Content:** The `app.py` file is open and active. We can see import statements from the FastAPI library, including `FastAPI`, `HTTPException`, `Query`, `PlainTextResponse`, `JSONResponse`, and `CORS`. This indicates that it is likely a web application.
*   **Code Snippets:**  There are lines of comments visible in the `app.py` code.

**Terminal Output Analysis:**

This is the most critical part for understanding the problem.

*   **HTTP 200 Response (Within a message):**  There's a message that starts with "A10 Task." This message indicates a task involving an SQLite database file located at `/data/ticket-sales.db`. The task is to calculate the total sales of "Gold" ticket types. The message further suggests the code has successfully executed within `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`.
*   **HTTP Request:** It shows an HTTP GET request being made to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`.
*   **Expected vs. Result:**
    *   `EXPECTED: 177250.79` - This is the value the program was supposed to return.
    *   `RESULT: 200401.84` - This is the actual value returned by the program.
*   **"A10 FAILED":** This explicitly states that the test case "A10" has failed.
*   **"Score: 4/10":** The project has an overall score of 4 out of 10.

**Other Details:**

*   **Operating System:** The prompt `PS C:\Users\avina\Desktop\TDS_Project3>` reveals that the user is on a Windows system.
*   **Laptop Keyboard:** A partial view of the keyboard is visible.

**In summary, the core issue is that the program returned an incorrect value (200401.84) for the "Gold" ticket sales calculation, while the expected value was 177250.79. This caused the A10 test case to fail.**

To replicate the test environment:

Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.

```
# /// script

Pass the required arguments to the above application and it will find the latest commit before the 18th, fetch it and unzip it to the folder you specified. Please use the appropriate arguments as specified in the application.

`docker build -t <your image name> .`

Run new docker image using  
`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 <your image name>`

Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder  
`uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

This then re-produces the exact environment how your application was tested.  
You have to provide a token from your environment for testing.

Then post with your queries after testing as mentioned above.  
Also check the evaluation logs first to see why it failed. Address that question.  
Posting “it ran before submission” is insufficient evidence.  
The whole point of deployability is that it runs anywhere at anytime.  
That is what is being tested, not that it ran on your machine (unless you replicate the test environment exactly).

Your repo is not public! Thats why we cannot see any other files either. If its not public we cannot see if other files exist. We cannot evaluate an invisible repo.

Dear @Jivraj @carlton Sir,  
I run evalution script that you provide us via mail recently, my code is actively running and able to pass 11 task but I was awarded 1 Marks pls check where is the issue,[My full code was done in linux Environment] (github codespace)  

image1380×341 63.6 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Content Overview:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal window, likely within a code editor (possibly VS Code).  It captures output from a program (potentially related to a "Large-Language-Model" project) and includes an interactive prompt about installing a Python extension.

**Textual Information:**

*   **HTTP Request/Response Output:**
    *   "HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt "HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND""
        *   This indicates a GET request to a local server on port 8000 to read the file `/data/c5.txt`.
        *   The response code "404 NOT FOUND" shows that the requested file was not found on the server.
    *   "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt"
        *   This confirms that the program attempted to read the file and failed.
    *   "X C5 FAILED"
        *   Further confirms failure
    *   "Score: 11/25"
        *   This could indicate the result of a test or evaluation, suggesting the program achieved a score of 11 out of 25.
    *   "HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK""
        *   This shows a successful POST request to an external API (likely related to OpenAI embeddings).
        *   The "200 OK" indicates that the request was successful.

*   **Terminal Prompt:**
    *   `@singh-yash129 →/workspaces/Large-Language-Model (main) $`
        *   This is a typical terminal prompt.
        *   `singh-yash129` is the username.
        *   `/workspaces/Large-Language-Model` is the current directory (the project's location).
        *   `(main)` indicates the current Git branch.

*   **Python Extension Prompt:**
    *   "Do you want to install the recommended 'Python' extension from Microsoft for the Python language?"
    *   "Install" and "Show Recommendations" are buttons for the user to click.

*   **Status Bar (Lower Right):**
    *   Ln 61, Col 4
    *   Spaces: 4
    *   UTF-8
    *   LF
    *   () Python
    *   Chat limit reached

**Objects and Features:**

*   **Terminal Window:** The main focus of the image is the terminal window, showing code execution output and user interaction.
*   **Pop-up Dialog:**  The prompt regarding the Python extension is overlaid on the terminal window as a dialog box.
*   **Icons:** There are icons in the taskbar that relate to different applications running on the computer (Chrome, VSCode, etc.)
*   **Clock:**  The clock in the lower right corner indicates the time (18:27:52) and date (06-04-2025).
*   **Operating System Interface:** The overall look and feel suggest the screenshot is from a desktop environment (possibly Windows or a Linux-based system).

**Things i have done for my project to work locally:**

carlton:

> `git clone <your repo url>`

cloned my repo which looked like this after cloning(ignore those green dots)  

image274×118 2.87 KB

All the files are in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the subfolder in the root directory,I shouldn’t get penalized for this) and added the datagen and evaluate.py file.

carlton:

> Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder

when i do this( ) i get this error

carlton:

> `docker build -t <your image name>`

```
PS D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1> docker build -t "tushar2k5/tds-project-1"                                                                 
ERROR: "docker buildx build" requires exactly 1 argument.
See 'docker buildx build --help'.

Usage:  docker buildx build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

Start a build

```

Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully we have to do either of the two things(taken help from chatgpt ):  
1)

```
Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1

```

**OR**  
2)

```
Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .

```

*Both the things work for me*()

carlton:

> `docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -P 8000:8000 <your image name>`

```
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=i.am.still.noob.inTDS -p 8000:8000 tushar2k5/tds-project-1

```

Done this(can’t leak my token,already many students stolen it from my project-2🤦‍♂️)

carlton:

> `uv run evaluate.py --email=<any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2003751@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 

```

Done this to evaluate my project

Any finally the main part (DRUM ROLLS ,not this one  (IUKUK))

**THATS 6/25**

Currently I’m getting a big 0 beacause the github doen’t contain the dockerfile(which it does clearly)

> Currently I’m getting a big 0 beacause the github doen’t contain the dockerfile(which it does clearly

Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in root folder of the repo.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image shows the letter "T" in white.
*   The background is a solid dark purple color.
*   The letter has a blurred or softened appearance, as though it has a slight glow or bloom effect around it.

**Features relevant for questions:**

*   **Text:** The letter "T" is the primary text element. This is important for understanding what the image depicts.
*   **Color:** The purple background color and the white letter color are relevant.
*   **Appearance:** The blurred or glowing appearance of the letter might indicate something about the image style or purpose.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files in the repo please consider it)@carlton @Saransh\_Saini @s.anand  
(i have already made a rookie mistake in my dockerfile otherwise i would have got 9/25 but keeping that aside please let me get 6/25)
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Central Figure:**

*   The main subject is an orange tabby cat with large, expressive eyes that are wide and glistening, giving it a pleading or begging expression.
*   The cat's fur is detailed with stripes, and it has a pink nose and white whiskers.
*   Its paws are slightly raised, as if in a begging gesture.

**Background:**

*   The background appears to be somewhat blurred, suggesting depth of field. It features green tones, possibly indicating foliage or grass. There is a white object in the background to the right side.

**Text:**

*   The word "PLEASE" is superimposed over the image at the bottom. It's in white text, making it stand out against the darker areas of the image.

**Overall Impression:**

*   The image evokes feelings of sympathy or pity due to the cat's facial expression and the inclusion of the word "PLEASE". The overall tone is likely intended to be humorous or endearing, playing on the "cute" factor of the cat.
*   The high resolution and detailed fur texture add to the image's appeal.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Based on its appearance, the cat seems to be computer animated, it resembles the look of 'Puss in Boots'.
*   The expression and pose are designed to elicit a response from the viewer, making it a popular image for memes and online reactions.
 Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Visual Description:**

The image shows an anime-style character sitting on a set of stairs. The character has a pale complexion and white or light gray hair. They are wearing a dark, possibly black, suit. The pose suggests a state of dejection or fatigue; they are slumped, with their head resting on their hand. The stairs themselves are a light brown or tan color and appear to be made of stone or concrete.

**Text:**

*   There is text at the top of the image that reads "WWW.BANDICAM.COM." This is a watermark indicating the use of Bandicam screen recording software.
*   There is text at the bottom of the image that reads "imgflip.com." This is a watermark of the imgflip website.

**Objects and Features:**

*   **Stairs:** These are a prominent feature, forming the setting for the character's pose.
*   **Suit:** The character's clothing, a dark suit, gives some indication of their possible role or personality.
*   **Pose:** The slumped posture conveys a sense of sadness, exhaustion, or frustration.
*   **Hair:** The pale hair color is a distinguishing feature of the character's design.
*   **Facial expression** Though the face is mostly covered, the slouched posture, head in hand, and shadowed face suggest negative emotions.

**Potential Inferences:**

Based on the image, we might infer that:

*   The character is experiencing emotional distress.
*   The image is likely a screen capture from an anime or animation.
*   The image may have been created or edited on imgflip.com.
*   Bandicam was used to capture the anime or animation.

Good evening sir.

My original project evaluation conducted by IITM gave me 7/20, however the new evaluation gave me 0/20.

image650×898 106 KB

This was from the official evaluation sir, could you kindly look into it.
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text and relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a log file or output snippet from a system evaluating a program or script. The dominant feature is the textual log entries, which indicate the execution of tasks, HTTP requests, and error messages.  There are also some visual indicators, such as checkmarks and crosses, suggesting success or failure.

**Key Textual Information:**

*   **Email Address:** At the top of the image, there's an email address: "23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\_evaluation.log". This likely identifies the user or process being evaluated and indicates this log is associated with an evaluation at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

*   **Task B9:** Several log entries relate to "B9".
    *   A successful message indicates "B9 Task 'Convert https://raw.githubusercontent.com/... to /data/b9.html' executed successfully".
    *   However, subsequent log entries show errors related to B9, such as "B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html" and a large red X next to "B9 FAILED". This suggests the task might be failing at a later stage even though it was initially converted successfully.

*   **Task B10:** Log entries also relate to "B10".
    *   The errors are similar to those of B9: "B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv" and a red X next to "B10 FAILED."

*   **HTTP Requests:** There are multiple HTTP requests logged, targeting "http://localhost:8301". The requests involve:
    *   "POST" requests to `/run` endpoint, likely executing tasks.
    *   "GET" requests to `/read`, probably attempting to read files.
    *   One POST request to /run includes a complex URL encoding what seems like a SQL query: "...sales.csv%3Fsql%3DSELECT%2BCOUNT%28%2A%29%2BFROM%2Btickets...". This suggests the system is trying to run a query against a CSV file.

*   **HTTP 400 Errors:** A "HTTP 400" error is logged with a "detail" message related to "HTTPConnectionPool" and failure to establish a new connection. The query in the 400 error is:"sql=SELECT+COUNT(\*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type+=%22Bronze...".

*   **Datasette:** References to "uvx datasette" and "datasette server" appear, indicating the system might be using Datasette (a tool for exploring and publishing data) to process data from CSV files.

*   **Score:** The line "Score: 7 / 20" indicates the system's performance, probably based on successfully completed tasks.

**Objects and Visual Features:**

*   **Checkmark:** A green checkmark appears before the successful message for task B9.
*   **Red X:** Red X marks next to "B9 FAILED" and "B10 FAILED" visually confirm the failures.

**In summary, the image shows the log output of a system evaluating a series of tasks (B9 and B10), involving data conversion, database queries (likely using Datasette), and file access. The log reveals failures related to reading files and possibly establishing database connections, resulting in a low score.**

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image features a yellow circular emoji.
*   The emoji has two dark brown, round eyes.
*   It has a downturned mouth, indicating sadness or unhappiness.
*   The background is solid black.

**Overall Impression:** The image is a straightforward depiction of a sad or unhappy face emoji.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Context:** The image appears to be a screenshot from a terminal or code editor window, likely showing the output of a program or system.

**Content Breakdown:**

*   **Error Messages:**
    *   "HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"" - This indicates that a GET request was made to the localhost server (port 8000) to read a file named "c5.txt" located in the "/data/" directory. The server responded with a "404 Not Found" error, meaning the file could not be found at the specified path.
    *   "C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt" - This confirms the failure to read the file, likely from within the application itself.
    *   "X C5 FAILED" - further confirms the failed state.

*   **Score:**
    *   "Score: 7 / 25" - This suggests some kind of evaluation or assessment within the application, with a score of 7 out of a possible 25.

*   **Successful Request:**
    *   "HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"" - A POST request was successfully made to an external API (aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev) to generate embeddings for OpenAI. The server responded with "200 OK", indicating success.

*   **Terminal/Command Line Prompt:**
    *   "PS C:\\Users\\choud\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\tds1\\TDS\_Project\_1>" - This is a PowerShell prompt showing the current directory: "C:\\Users\\choud\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\tds1\\TDS\_Project\_1". This helps understand the location of the project or files being worked on.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image shows a situation where a program is trying to read a local file ("c5.txt") but fails, receiving a "404 Not Found" error. Meanwhile, the program has successfully made an API request to an external service for OpenAI embeddings. There is also information about a score, likely related to the program's performance or some evaluation metric.

In summary, the image captures a debugging or development scenario where the program encounters a file access error but successfully interacts with an external API.

Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.

Sir, could you please fetch my latest GitHub commit before 18th Feb and build the image through that one?  
I received a mail saying that the Docker image is not accessible, but it is already there. Kindly request you to evaluate my submission.

Hi @Abhay222

Docker image submitted by you doesn’t exists.

image1902×943 93.3 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**
The image shows a Docker Hub webpage displaying a 404 error. The page is visually dominated by a large blue circle containing the error message.

**Page Elements:**

*   **Header:** The header section, identifiable by its blue background, contains several elements:
    *   Docker Hub Logo:  The Docker Hub logo is on the left side.
    *   Search Bar: A search bar is prominently placed in the center.
    *   Keyboard Shortcut Icon: A "Ctrl+K" shortcut is visible next to the search bar.
    *   Other Icons: Icons related to settings, updates, and possibly a profile are present on the right side.
    *   Sign In/Sign Up Buttons: Buttons for "Sign In" and "Sign Up" are located at the far right.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Below the header, there is breadcrumb navigation: "Explore / abhay227 / version1". This suggests a navigation path within the Docker Hub website.
*   **Error Message (404):**
    *   Number: The large number "404" indicates the HTTP error code.
    *   Text: The message "Oops!" is displayed above the text "The page you have requested was not found."
    *   Icon: An illustration is present beneath the error message. It appears to depict a person peering over the top of a computer screen, possibly to illustrate confusion or frustration over the error.

**URL:**
The URL in the browser bar reads: `https://hub.docker.com/r/abhay227/version1/tags`. This indicates the user was trying to access the tags section of a repository named "version1" owned by a user or organization named "abhay227" on Docker Hub.

**Colors:**
The predominant colors are a dark blue/black for the background, a vibrant blue for the error circle and header, and white for text elements.

**Interpretation:**

The user attempted to access a specific page on Docker Hub (likely a specific tagged version of a Docker image), but the page was not found. This could be due to a typo in the URL, the image or tag not existing, or other Docker Hub-related issues.

Hi @23f1000879

This basically tells you didn’t validate docker Dockerfile and docker image by building and running them, otherwise you would have corrected the mistake.

repo that you submitted through google form was different then this one.

Your Gform response

image1660×242 21.9 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a data table, likely displayed in a web-based application or interface.  It shows information related to a student project, specifically concerning GitHub repository links and DockerHub image names. The top of the image shows some navigation elements ("Preview", "Code", "Blame", file size). There is a search bar at the top with an email address in it.

**Table Structure and Columns:**

The table has the following columns:

1.  **Timestamp:** The date and time when the data was recorded.
2.  **Email Address:** An email address, in this case `23f1001120@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
3.  **What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?**  This column contains URLs pointing to GitHub repositories.
4.  **What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?** This column contains the names of images published on DockerHub

**Data Rows:**

There's at least one visible data row with the following information:

*   **Row Number:** 919
*   **Timestamp:** `2/16/2025 23:10:43`
*   **Email Address:** `23f1001120@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
*   **GitHub Repository Link:**  `https://github.com/23f1001120/Tds_Project1`
*   **DockerHub Image Name:** `abhay227/version1`

**Additional Elements:**

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”

If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?

We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.

@carlton @Jivraj  
Dear Sir,  
I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.  
I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is  
CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”] has an **invisible Unicode non-breaking space** (`U+00A0`) between `"run", "app.py"` instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.  
I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE. Expecting a positive response from your end.

sir, but before submission i run evluate.py and it gave me 8/10 in task A. after submission i also got result mail stating that i got 8/20.  

image1895×938 90 KB

  
also this mail result Earlier i got From your side.
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image shows a screen capture, possibly from a web browser or application displaying logs and error messages.
*   The background appears to be a dark theme, with light text on a dark background.
*   A navigation menu or sidebar is visible on the left side.

**Text Content and Error Messages:**

The core of the image contains a log or evaluation report with several errors and status messages related to a data processing task. Here is the breakdown of relevant text:

*   **File Name:** 23f1000879@ds.study.ltm.ac.in_evaluation.log
*   **"XB7 FAILED"**: indicates failed processes due to "not all arguments converted during string formatting"
*   **Running task**: "Convert [URL] to HTML and save it to '/data/b9.html'" (The URL is "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octocat/spoon-knife/d0dd1f41b33d44e29dfbc1372a94edfa2fee76a9/README.md").
*   **HTTP Request**: POST to http://localhost:8243 with task to Convert the URL to HTML. Status "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
*   The log reports "Task 'convert [URL] to HTML and save it to /data/b9.html' executed successfully"
*   **HTTP Request**: GET http://localhost:8243/read?path=/data/b9.html.  "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found".
*   **"XB9 failed"**: "Cannot read /data/b9.html"
*   **"XB9 FAILED"**: Indicates failure due to "Cannot read /data/b9.html"
*   **Running task**: "Run dataset via uuvx dataset /data/ticket-sales.db port 8001 in the background. From "tickets" count the number of rows where "type" is Bronze using http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv/sql?SELECT+COUNT(*) FROM+tickets+WHERE+type=%22Bronze%22 and save it to /data/b10.csv." and then stop the datasette server.
*   **HTTP Request**: POST http://localhost:8243 to run task on the ticket dataset.  "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request".
*   **HTTP 400**: Contains a "detail" key with the error message "HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /ticket-sales.csv/sql?SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type=%22Bronze%22 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7e935ed27bfd0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))"
*   **HTTP Request**: GET http://localhost:8243/read?path=/data/b10.csv.  "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found".
*   **"XB10 failed"**: "Cannot read /data/b10.csv"
*   **"XB10 FAILED"**
*   **Score: 0 / 20**
*   **HTTP Request**: GET https://aigday.ansand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

**Overall Assessment:**

The logs indicate a series of failures during data processing. There appear to be issues with converting HTML files, reading files from the local server (404 errors), and connecting to a database server on localhost. The "Connection refused" error suggests a problem with the database server being available. The initial failure related to string formatting may be related to how arguments are being passed to a function or command.

If you provide specific questions about the image, I can try to answer them based on this description.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a single emoji. It's a yellow, round face with a sad expression.

*   **Facial Features:**
    *   **Eyes:** Two small, round, dark brown eyes looking straight ahead. They appear to be downcast, which contributes to the sad emotion.
    *   **Mouth:** A downturned, curved line represents a frowning or sad mouth.
    *   **Color:** The face is a standard yellow color, typical for emoji.

**Overall Impression:** The overall impression is one of sadness, disappointment, or general unhappiness. It's a clear and simple representation of the feeling of being sad.

Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag `"abhay227/version1"` instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is `4db729a03f74`, which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly available.  
Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all the effort I’ve put into the project. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

Hi, all my pre-requisites have been fulfilled, and the evaluation logs say I have a score of 10/25. But I have gotten a score of 0, saying ‘Task A module missing’. This is a kind request to confirm the scores.
The image shows a checklist titled "Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)". It lists four items:
1. Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
2. Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
3. Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1
4. Github repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1

Each item ends with the number "1", indicating that each pre-requisite has been met.

The types of errors include missing modules ("taskA", "app", "flask", "openai", "PhaseA"), syntax errors, environment file issues, and container configuration problems.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a Windows File Explorer window. The title bar indicates it's dealing with a zipped archive.

**Top Area:**

*   **Title Bar:** Reads "23f1001524 - docker\_logs.zip" multiple times. This implies the window is displaying the contents of a zip archive named "docker\_logs.zip", presumably associated with a number "23f1001524".
*   **Address Bar:** Shows the current location is "Downloads > docker\_logs.zip". This clarifies that we are viewing the contents of the "docker\_logs.zip" archive within the "Downloads" folder.
*   **Search Bar:** The search bar contains the value "23f1001524", indicating the user has typed it in as a search term.
*   **Details Button:** There's a "Details" button in the upper right corner of the window.

**Left Sidebar:**

*   The standard Windows File Explorer sidebar is present, with shortcuts to common locations:
    *   Home
    *   Gallery
    *   OneDrive
    *   Desktop
    *   Downloads
    *   Documents
    *   Pictures
    *   Music
    *   Videos
    *   Etc

**Main Content Area:**

*   The main window is showing the contents of the "docker\_logs.zip" archive.
*   Column headers are visible: "Name", "Type", "Compressed size", "Password p.", "Size", "Ratio", "Date modified"
*   The message "No items match your search" is displayed. This means the search term "23f1001524" didn't find any matching files or folders within the archive currently displayed.
*   There are standard options to "Extract all" and to "Sort" the files.

**In summary:**

The image depicts a user searching for something within a "docker\_logs.zip" archive, located in the "Downloads" folder. The user entered "23f1001524" as the search term, but no matching files were found within the archive.
 Here's a description of the image's content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Context:**

The image is a screenshot of a Windows File Explorer window. It shows the contents of a ZIP archive named "evaluation_logs.zip" located within the "Downloads" folder.

**Key Elements and Text:**

*   **Title Bar:**  Shows the full path and filename: "23f1001524 - evaluation_logs.zip".
*   **Address Bar:** Shows the current directory path as "Downloads > evaluation_logs.zip".
*   **Ribbon:**  Includes standard File Explorer ribbon elements such as "New," "Sort," "View," and "Extract all".
*   **Left Navigation Pane:**  Shows the standard Windows File Explorer locations, including "Home," "Gallery," "OneDrive - Pers," "Desktop," "Downloads," "Documents," "Pictures," "Music," "Videos," "itn" etc. The "Downloads" folder is highlighted, indicating it is the current directory.
*   **Main Content Pane:** This pane displays the contents of the "evaluation_logs.zip" archive. However, it is currently empty, displaying the text "No items match your search".
*   **Column Headers:**  The main content pane has column headers like "Name," "Type," "Compressed Size," "Password p," "Size," "Ratio," and "Date Modified."
*   **Search Bar:**  In the upper right, there is a search bar with the number "2311001524" entered.

**Observations:**

*   The archive "evaluation_logs.zip" exists, and the File Explorer is viewing its contents.
*   The archive is currently empty, meaning no files or folders are contained within it.
*   A search term "2311001524" has been entered, which is probably a case of a fruitless search, leading to the "No items match your search" result.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a report or evaluation, likely related to a software project or coding assignment. It's structured with text sections, a table-like grid, and some metadata at the top.

**Top Section (Metadata & Project Info):**

*   **"Your final t score calculation is based on MIN (20, (task score + bonus))"**: This indicates the primary metric being assessed is a 't score,' calculated based on a task score and a bonus. The 'MIN' function suggests a maximum possible t score of 20.
*   **"Github repo submitted: [URL]"**:  This provides the URL to the submitted GitHub repository. The URL appears to be `https://github.com/veershah1231/tds_proj_1`.
*   **"Docker repo submitted: [repo name]"**:  This shows the name of the submitted Docker repository, listed as `veershah1231/tdsproject1final`.

**Pre-requisites Check:**

*   **"Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)"**: This section outlines the mandatory requirements for the project, with a binary scoring system (1 for passing, 0 for failing).
*   **List of Pre-requisites (all with a value of "1"):**
    *   "Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1"
    *   "Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1"
    *   "Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1"
    *   "Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1"
    All of these prerequisites are met.

**Table/Grid Section:**

*   It is a grid composed of three rows of cells, named respectively from A1 to A10, B1 to B10, and C1 to C5.
*   Every cell in the grid contains the number 0.

**Bottom Section (Scores & Notes):**

*   **"Your task score is: 0"**: The base task score is 0.
*   **"Your bonus is: 1"**: A bonus of 1 was awarded.
*   **"Your P1 score is: 1"**: An additional score, labelled "P1 score," is 1.
*   **"We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites."**: This note confirms that log files are available for those who met the prerequisites.
*   **"You will only have an evaluation log if your API service actually started working within 6 minutes. Otherwise you will have only a docker log."**: This is a conditional statement regarding the type of log file available, dependent on the API service's startup time.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image shows a successful check against the project prerequisites. The GitHub and Docker repositories exist, are public, include a license, and contain a Dockerfile. Despite this, the base task score is zero. A bonus of 1 and P1 score of 1 were awarded. The grid suggests a more detailed, possibly segmented, scoring system that was unused.

@carlton and @Jivraj , for Task A i had tested before and all the test cases passed, but all my A tasks has failed with 0, In the evaluation logs, i could see that all task A tests failed due to datagen.py not available.

Could you rerun the test ?

Respected Sir,

Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.  
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment  
I cloned my repository using:

```
bash
git clone <my_repo_url>
cd <my_repo_directory>
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Issue with Original Submission  
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.

However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.  
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.

Action Taken  
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:

The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.

It responds to requests within the required timeframe.

I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:  
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest

Request for Re-Evaluation  
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.

Previous Message for Reference  
For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:

"Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!"

There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?

Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science

> To replicate the test environment:
> Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that
> import requests
> import pandas
> DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")
> url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
> try :
> response = requests.get(url,headers=github\_headers, timeout=60)
> fetch\_commit = None
> if response.status\_code == 200:
> commits = response.json()
> for commit in commits:
> sha = commit["sha"]
> …

Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.  
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.

Kind regards

You can take it up with @s.anand  
I did not come up with the standard.  
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

> Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.

Kindest regards.

the link for evaluation in which i got 7/20 is : 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\_evaluation.log - Google Drive  

image1315×732 45.7 KB

  
MOST importantly mail shows :  
**Your final t score** calculation is based on

MIN (20, (task score + bonus))

**Github repo submitted:** GitHub - 23f2001390/llmagent

**Docker repo submitted:** 23f2001390/llmagent

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**

Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1

Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1

Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1  
Your task score is: 0  
Your bonus is: 1  
Your P1 score is: 1

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:  
We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.

but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker\_logs.zip or evaluation\_logs.zip that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
and nor do i find my id in the p1\_evaluation\_error\_logs so please help sir

Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text and relevant features:

**Overall Impression**

The image shows a log file from a program evaluation. The log indicates several errors during the execution of tasks related to a "datasette" (likely a data exploration tool) and some API calls. The overall score is 7/20, suggesting that the evaluation didn't go well.

**Key Textual Elements and their Interpretation:**

*   **`23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`**: This is likely the filename or identifier of the log file. It suggests the evaluation is taking place at IIT Madras (iitm.ac.in) in the domain of Data Science studies (ds.study).
*   **`B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html`** and **`B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv`**: These lines indicate that the program failed to read two files, `/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv`. This is a crucial error that points towards a problem with file access or creation.
*   **`Running task: Run datasette via 'uvx datasette /data/ticket-sales.db --port 8001' in the background.`**:  This describes the task being attempted: launching a datasette instance in the background. It is using the `uvx` library. The datasette is serving the database `/data/ticket-sales.db` on port 8001.
*   **`From 'tickets' count the number of rows where 'type' is "Bronze" using http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type+=%22Bronze%22 and save it to /data/b10.csv. Then stop the datasette server.`**:  This describes the intended SQL query and data manipulation task.
    *   It is supposed to query the `ticket-sales.db` database.
    *   The query is `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE type = "Bronze"`. It counts the number of rows in the `tickets` table where the `type` column is equal to "Bronze".
    *   The result of this query is intended to be saved to the file `/data/b10.csv`.
    *   Finally, the datasette server should be stopped.
*   **`HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8369/run?...`**: This is the HTTP request to start the datasette task. The URL suggests that there is a process running at `localhost:8369` that manages task execution. The long string after `/run?task=` is a URL-encoded representation of the task to be performed. The `400 Bad Request` message indicates the request was malformed.
*   **`HTTP 400 { "detail": "HTTPConnectionPool... Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))"`**:  This is an HTTP error indicating that the program couldn't connect to the datasette server at `localhost:8001`. The `Connection refused` error suggests that the server was either not running or not accessible on that port.
*   **`HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8369/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"`**: This is an HTTP request to read the file `/data/b10.csv`. The `404 Not Found` error confirms that the file doesn't exist (likely because the datasette task failed to create it).
*   **`HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`**: This indicates a successful HTTP request to an AI proxy server. It is using `openai/v1/embeddings`, which suggests the use of OpenAI's embeddings API, likely to encode text.

**Overall Diagnosis**

The root cause of the problem seems to be that the datasette server failed to start or connect properly. This resulted in the program failing to execute the SQL query, create the `/data/b10.csv` file, and failing the overall evaluation. The OpenAI embeddings API call seems to be unrelated to the primary failure.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an evaluation or results page for a project. It contains text headers, values, and what seems to be a series of scores or flags organized in a grid/table.

**Top Section:**

*   **Repository Submissions:** It displays the GitHub and Docker repository URLs for the project, using the prefix of '23f2001390/ilmagent'.
*   **Pre-requisite Checks:** A section titled "Pre-requisites check" explains that a value of "1" indicates a pass, and "0" indicates a failure. The following checks are listed:
    *   Docker repo exists and is public (timestamp before 18th Feb): 1 (passed)
    *   Github repo exists and is public (timestamp before 18th Feb): 1 (passed)
    *   Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1 (passed)
    *   Github repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1 (passed)

**Grid Section:**

*   **Headers:** A table or grid structure is presented with rows labeled A, B, and C. The columns are numbered 1 through 10 for rows A and B, and 1 through 5 for row C.
*   **Values:** Each cell in the grid contains the value "0". This appears to indicate either a failure or an absence of a positive result for each A, B, or C row/column.

**Score Section:**

*   **Task Score:** "Your task score is: 0"
*   **Bonus:** "Your bonus is: 1"
*   **P1 Score:** "Your P1 score is: 1"

**Final Statement:**

*   A final statement describes that Docker logs and evaluation logs are attached for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.
*   A condition is mentioned on receiving the evaluation log. It will only exist if the API service actually started working within 5 minutes, otherwise, only a docker log exists.

**In summary:**

The image shows a status/results page indicating successful pre-requisite checks, but the task score itself is zero. There's a bonus and a P1 score of 1 each. Evaluation logs might or might not be present, depending on whether the API service started within 5 minutes. The rows A, B, and C are filled with the value '0', indicating some form of a failure.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a Windows Explorer window displaying the contents of a ZIP file. The window indicates that no items match the current search.

**Specific Elements:**

*   **Navigation Bar:** The top of the window shows the navigation path:
    *   `This PC > Downloads > docker_logs.zip` This indicates the window is showing the contents of the "docker\_logs.zip" file, located in the Downloads folder of "This PC".
*   **Search Bar:**  The search bar on the right side of the title bar contains the text `23f2001390`. This suggests that a search was performed within the "docker\_logs.zip" file for this string.
*   **Column Headers:** The main content area has column headers:
    *   `Name`
    *   `Type`
    *   `Compressed size`
    *   `Password p...` (Likely truncated "Password protected")
*   **Content Area:** The message "No items match your search." appears in the content area, meaning the search for `23f2001390` found no matches within the ZIP file.
*   **Preview Pane:** On the right side of the window, the text "Select a file to preview" indicates that no file is currently selected to be previewed.

**In Summary:**

The image depicts a Windows Explorer window displaying an empty search result within a ZIP file named "docker\_logs.zip". The search term used was "23f2001390".
 Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a Windows file explorer window. The window is currently displaying the contents of a .zip file named "evaluation_logs.zip" located in the "Downloads" folder.  The window also indicates that a search has been performed, and the search results came back empty.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Title Bar:** "This PC > Downloads > evaluation_logs.zip"  This indicates the current location/path being viewed in the file explorer.
*   **Column Headers:** "Name", "Type", "Compressed Size", "Password p…" These are the headers for the columns displaying information about files within the "evaluation_logs.zip" archive.
*   **Search Bar:** The upper right corner contains a search bar with the text "23f2001390". This suggests someone has entered this string as a search query within the folder.
*   **Content Area:** The main area of the window displays the message "No items match your search." This means that the search performed within the "evaluation_logs.zip" file yielded no results.
*   **Preview Pane:** On the right side, it says "Select a file to preview." This indicates that no file is currently selected to be displayed.
*   **Navigation Arrows:** Small arrows at the bottom left indicate navigation capabilities within the file explorer.
*   **Minimize and Close buttons:** On the upper-right corner, there is an "x" button for closing the window, which is typical for windows applications.

**In Summary:**

The image depicts a user searching for a specific string (23f2001390) within a .zip file named "evaluation_logs.zip", but the search was unsuccessful, as indicated by the "No items match your search" message.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image shows a spreadsheet, likely from Google Sheets, titled "p1_evaluation_error_logs."  The spreadsheet contains two columns labeled "email" and "error_reason," suggesting it is a log of errors related to email addresses.

**Detailed breakdown of Columns:**

*   **Column A (email):** This column lists email addresses, all of which appear to be associated with the domain "ds.study.itm.ac.in". The email addresses follow a numerical pattern, likely student IDs.
*   **Column B (error\_reason):** This column provides descriptions of the errors associated with each email. Here's a breakdown of the error types present:
    *   "requests module missing"
    *   "application running on 5000 port"
    *   "functions module missing"
    *   "Usage: /app/start.sh "
    *   "/bin/sh: 1: [root/local/bin/uv, not found"
    *   "app module missing"
    *   "nest\_asyncio module missing"
    *   "whisper module missing"
    *   "taskA module missing" (This is a recurring error)
    *   "SyntaxError: unmatched '"
    *   "flask\_cors module missing"
    *   "error: Failed to spawn: 'app.py', Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)"
    *   "Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)"
    *   "phaseA module missing"

**Important Observations:**

*   **Recurring Errors:** The most common error reported is "taskA module missing," indicating a problem with a specific module.
*   **Module Problems:** A significant portion of the errors relate to missing modules (e.g., "requests," "functions," "app," "nest\_asyncio," "whisper," "taskA"). This suggests issues with dependencies or the project's environment.
*   **File Not Found:** There's an error related to the "app.py" file not being found, implying a problem with file paths or project structure.
*   **Docker Configuration:** One error indicates an issue with Docker container configuration, specifically the binding of the container to the wrong IP address.
*   **Potential Environment/Dependency Issues:** The prevalence of module-related errors points towards environment configuration issues, missing dependencies, or incorrect project setup.

**Additional elements:**

*   **Toolbar:** The standard Google Sheets toolbar is visible, including options for "File," "Edit," "View," "Insert," "Format," "Data," "Tools," and "Extensions."
*   **Percentage:** In the toolbar, it shows that it is set to 100%
*   **"View Only" button** In the toolbar, a view only button is enabled

**Possible Questions it can answer:**

*   What types of errors are common in this evaluation?
*   Which modules are frequently reported as missing?
*   Is there any indication of environment configuration problems?
*   Are there any email addresses associated with a specific type of error?
*   What are the specific error messages logged in the system?

Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Image:**

The image shows a screenshot of a Google Sheets document.  The document appears to be a log of errors from an evaluation process (likely of code or software). The title of the sheet is "p1_evaluation_error_logs."

**Header:**

*   **File Menu:** At the very top is the standard Google Sheets menu: "File," "Edit," "View," "Insert," "Format," "Data," "Tools," "Extensions," "Help."
*   **Toolbar:** Below the menu bar, there's a toolbar with icons.  Some are partially visible (e.g., print icon, undo/redo). The zoom level is set to "100%" and there is a button to switch between "View only" and edit modes.
*   **Search/Filter:** There's a search box likely used to find specific content within the sheet. It has the value "2312001481" entered, and shows "0 of 0" results.

**Spreadsheet Data:**

The spreadsheet contains two columns: "email" and "A".
The "email" column contains email addresses.
The "A" column contains error messages.

**Key Error Messages (Representative Samples):**

Here are some of the error messages visible in the image:

*   "taskA module missing" (appears frequently)
*   "pydub module missing"
*   "couldt import module app"
*   "Could not import module "MAIN""
*   "flask module missing"
*   "PhaseA module missing"
*   "Attribute 'app' not found in module 'app'"
*   "ImportError: cannot import name 'logger' from 'app.utils.logger'"
*   "SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 306)"
*   "Container was bound to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 which is why docker container port 8000 is not accessible outside(host os)" (appears multiple times)
*   "pytesseract module missing"
*   "ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
*   "RuntimeError: Cannot install on Python version 3.12.9, only versions >=3.6,<3.10 are supported"

**Interpretation:**

The spreadsheet likely tracks errors encountered when running or testing code submissions from different users (identified by their email addresses). The error messages indicate common problems such as missing modules, import errors, syntax errors, and container configuration issues. The last error message indicates issues with Python version compatibility.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a single emoji.

*   **Shape:** The emoji is a yellow circle, a common shape for depicting faces.
*   **Facial Features:** The emoji has simple features: two small, round, dark brown eyes and a black curved line representing a smile.
*   **Additional Element:** On the left side of the face, near the smile, is a single, large, blue teardrop.

**Overall Impression:** The emoji appears to represent a state of bittersweet emotion. It has a smile which would be considered a happy or content emotion, but the teardrop suggests sadness or a moment of somberness. Thus, the image could be interpreted as "smiling through tears," relief, pride, or a similar mixed feeling.

Hi Hari,

Your docker failed to build.

Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in

Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science

> To replicate the test environment:
> Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that
> import requests
> import pandas
> DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")
> url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
> try :
> response = requests.get(url,headers=github\_headers, timeout=60)
> fetch\_commit = None
> if response.status\_code == 200:
> commits = response.json()
> for commit in commits:
> sha = commit["sha"]
> …

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs.  
90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.

The specific error in your case is:  
tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists

Thats why there are no logs.  
Kind regards

Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup.

What’s the take away for everyone? Let’s move on. This isn’t the end.

What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.

Most common reason for during running docker image was `taskA module was missing` which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.

This is error that you got while building docker image using docker file in your github repo tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists

In your Dockerfile you are trying to copy requirements.txt but it doesn’t exists in the directory where Dockerfile is located

While running docker image create by your github repo, we got following error `taskA module missing`

For regenerating it follow steps that are mentioned here : Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies - #316
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a square graphic with a simple design. The background is a solid, vibrant orange color. In the center of the square, there is a large, white, capital "M".

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Letter:** The capital "M" is the dominant element. It's white, giving it high contrast against the orange background. The font appears to be a sans-serif style, possibly a rounded or slightly blurred font.
*   **Color:** The orange background is a warm, eye-catching hue.
*   **Composition:** The "M" is centered both horizontally and vertically within the square. The focus is very clear and simple, drawing attention to the letter.

**Possible Questions the Image Could Help Answer:**

*   What is the letter being represented? (Answer: M)
*   What color is the background? (Answer: Orange)
*   What is the color of the letter? (Answer: White)
*   Is the letter centered? (Answer: Yes)
*   Does it look like the letter is outlined? (Answer: Yes)

In summary, it's a basic image, likely used as an icon, logo, or placeholder, possibly representing a name, brand, or category beginning with the letter "M".

Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically  
when:  
`uv run app.py` is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building).  
my dockerfile from the repo:

```
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

```

here u can see it installs using pip install …

here it’s requiring `.env` file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had `.env` file for AIPROXY\_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that `.env` file but as git doesn’t allow upload of `.env` file I couldn’t upload`.env` to git

the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY\_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because`.env` file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the `.env` file so it didn’t build so I had to create the `.env` file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the `.env` file(it supports both`.env` file and environment variable one)

After filling form you didn’t double check form.

Abhay222:

> I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

We can’t reconsider it.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   **Primary Element:** The image features the uppercase letter "A" as the central and predominant element.
*   **Color Scheme:** The background is a solid, deep blue color.
*   **Letter Style:** The letter "A" is white or a very light shade, and appears to have a slight blurry or out-of-focus effect, perhaps to suggest a subtle glow or soft lighting. The letter appears to have a faint white outline, making it stand out against the blue background.

**Possible Interpretations & Observations:**

*   **Simplicity:** The image is minimalist in its design, focusing on a single character and color combination.
*   **Purpose:** It could represent an initial, a label, a placeholder, or a part of a sequence. The blur suggests maybe it is part of an animation.
*   **Design Considerations:** The blue background provides a strong contrast with the white letter, making it highly visible.
*   **Potential Applications:** This image could be used for branding (if it represents a company's initial), for educational purposes, or as part of a larger graphic design project.

If you have more questions about the image, feel free to ask!

Here is a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a browser window displaying a log file. It appears to be an evaluation log, likely from an automated system. The log contains error messages, HTTP requests, and a score.

**Key Textual Elements:**

*   **File Name:**  `23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in_evaluation.log`. This indicates the log belongs to a user with this email address in the "ds.study.iitm.ac.in" domain.
*   **"B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html"**:  This is an error message, suggesting that the system tried to read a file named "b9.html" in the "/data" directory, but it failed.
*   **"X B9 FAILED"**:  Another error indicator, reinforcing the failure to read the file.
*   **Task Description:** This is a description of a running task in a 'uvx datasette'. It tries to count the number of rows in 'tickets' with 'type' "Bronze" using `http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv`. And it saves to 'data/b10.csv'
*   **HTTP Requests:** Several HTTP requests are logged. These requests reveal the system's attempts to perform operations.
    *   `POST http://localhost:8369/run?task=...`:  A POST request to a local server at port 8369, likely to run a task involving the "uvx datasette."
    *   `GET http://localhost:8369/read?path=/data/b10.csv`: A GET request attempting to read "/data/b10.csv" from the local server. It resulted in a "404 Not Found" error.
    *  `POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`
*   **Error Message (HTTP 400):** The POST request to `/run` returns the error "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request".
*  **Error Message (HTTP 400):** The POST request to `/run` logs HTTP 400 code with the detail about exceeding the max retries to the specified URL, and the connection is refused.
*   **"B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv"**: Similar to the "B9 failed" message, this indicates a failure to read a file named "b10.csv" in the "/data" directory.
*   **"X B10 FAILED"**: Error indicator.
*   **"Score: 7 / 20"**:  This indicates a score of 7 out of 20, likely representing the performance or success rate of the evaluated system.

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Error Indicators:** The use of "X" likely indicates a failed operation.
*   **Color Coding:** Red color likely highlight error messages

**In summary, the image displays a log file from an automated evaluation system, showing several failures to read files from a local server ("B9" and "B10"). The system also encountered errors when running a task related to the 'uvx datasette'. The overall score is low (7/20).**

Anything after deadline we can’t consider any changes, it was just a matter of time, you didn’t tests running evaluate.py on docker container that was created, otherwise you would have spotted this mistake and rectified it.

In your github repo, Dockerfile should be named as Dockerfile(D caps).

I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker image.  
Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems.

LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus marks.

@carlton @jivraj sir it is my humble request to do something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.

Sir but i did test my project via evaluate.py and got the 8/10 in my tasks A. A simple port error has resulted in no evaluation at all after all the hardwork.

Sir, how my git repo is not consistent i used the same repo which i have given you in the form even i did not commit any changes after 18th feb also in my docker file there is just a simple mistake that i forgot to add flask dependency just because of that mistake i am losing my marks. I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s.

Dear Sir,  
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.

Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.

With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

Hi @23f1001524 @afsalshah @23f1000879 @23f1002056

I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.

We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.

**A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.**

**Critical failures prevents everything else from working** and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.

I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.

Kindest regards

Hi @carlton ,

I couldn’t find my Docker logs or evaluation logs in the latest result mail, even though I had passed the prerequisites. I also tried reproducing the test environment and scored 9/25 (screenshot attached below).  

image1124×268 9.8 KB

Would really appreciate it if you could take a look. Thanks in advance!
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a terminal output, likely from a code editor or command-line interface. It indicates a program execution, specifically the results of some HTTP requests and scoring.

**Text Breakdown:**

*   **"> TERMINAL"**: This indicates the content is from a terminal.
*   **"HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt \"HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\""**: This shows a GET request to a local server (localhost:8000), trying to read a file at the path "/data/c5.txt".  The response code is "500 Internal Server Error," meaning the server encountered a problem fulfilling the request.
*   **"C5 failed: Cannot read /data/c5.txt"**: This highlights that an operation named "C5" failed because the system couldn't read the file at "/data/c5.txt".
*   **"X C5 FAILED"**: Another indication that task C5 failed
*   **"Score: 9 / 25"**:  The user obtained a score of 9 out of a possible 25, likely in some kind of assessment or evaluation.
*   **"HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\""**: This shows a POST request to a remote API endpoint related to OpenAI embeddings. The response code is "200 OK", which suggests that the request was successful. The API endpoint is `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`.

**Key Features and Deductions:**

*   **File Access Issue:** The core problem is the inability to read the file "/data/c5.txt". This could be due to:
    *   The file not existing at that location.
    *   The program lacking the necessary permissions to access the file.
    *   An incorrect file path.
*   **OpenAI Embeddings:** The successful POST request suggests the program interacts with the OpenAI API for generating embeddings (vector representations of text or data).
*   **Debugging/Testing:** The overall context points to a debugging or testing scenario where the program is being evaluated based on its ability to process data and interact with APIs.

In short, it looks like a program attempted to read a local file (c5.txt) and failed, leading to a lower score. It also successfully made a request to OpenAI to generate embeddings.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image is an emoji. It depicts a yellow face with a hand on its forehead.

**Features:**

*   **Face:** The face is round and yellow, typical of emoji. It has two small, round, brown eyes and a simple, closed mouth that suggests a neutral or slightly positive expression.
*   **Hand:** A yellow hand is positioned on the forehead of the emoji. The hand is shown in a manner that suggests a gesture.
*   **Color:** The colors are primarily yellow and brown.

**Possible Meanings/Interpretations:**

Based on the elements present, here are some potential meanings or interpretations of this emoji:

*   **Facepalm:** This is the most likely interpretation. The hand on the forehead is a universally recognized gesture of exasperation, embarrassment, frustration, or disbelief.
*   **Forgetfulness:** The hand on the forehead could suggest trying to remember something.
*   **Heat/Temperature:** While less likely given the context, the hand could also represent feeling hot or feverish.
*   **Salute:** The hand gesture can resemble a salute in which case this emoji can denote respect.

Without further context, the "facepalm" meaning is the most prevalent.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   **Emoji:** The image shows a single emoji, specifically the "Upside-Down Face" emoji.
*   **Appearance:** The emoji is a yellow, circular face. The mouth is displayed as an upside-down curve, and the eyes are represented by two circular dots. The overall impression is that of a smiley face turned upside down.

**Features:**

*   **Color:** Predominantly yellow.
*   **Shape:** Round/Circular.
*   **No Text:** There is no visible text within the image.

This emoji is commonly used to convey sarcasm, irony, silliness, or a sense of being upside down or confused about something.

@carlton @jivraj @s.anand,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.

I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.

I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.

I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.

Thank you
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Visual Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) integrated development environment (IDE). It's laid out with a standard IDE structure:

*   **Left Sidebar:** Shows the file explorer with the project named "llmagent" expanded.  We can see files like `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `Dockerfile`, `evaluate.py`, `LICENSE`, `readme.md`, `tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py` inside.
*   **Center Area:** Displays the VS Code "Start" screen.  Options like "New File," "Open File," "Open Folder," "Clone Git Repository," and "Connect to" are visible. A "Recent" section is also present showing an entry for "Ilmagent-3bb328b23e37497a0117aa393731a49758a5708d" along with its path.
*   **Right Sidebar:** Shows the "Walkthrough" feature.  Options like "Learn to..." and "Get Started" are visible.
*   **Bottom Panel:** This is the terminal panel.  It shows a PowerShell (PS) prompt, along with the output of a Git clone command.

**Textual Content and Important Details:**

*   **Project Name:**  The project is named "llmagent."
*   **File Types:** The files in the project suggest it's likely a Python project (due to `.py` files) potentially with Docker integration.
*   **Git Cloning:** The terminal shows the following command being executed: `git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/1lmagent.git`. This means a Git repository is being cloned into the "llmagent" folder.
*   **Clone Output:** The output of the `git clone` command shows the cloning process progressing:
    *   Enumerating objects.
    *   Counting objects.
    *   Compressing objects.
    *   Receiving objects.
    *   Resolving deltas.
    *   All steps report "done."
*   **Terminal Prompt:** The PowerShell prompt indicates the current directory is `C:\Users\USER\Downloads\New folder (33)`.
*   **Tabs at bottom:** There are tabs for "PROBLEMS", "OUTPUT", "DEBUG CONSOLE", "TERMINAL" and "PORTS".

**In summary:**  The image shows a VS Code workspace where a Git repository called "llmagent" is being cloned from a GitHub URL. The project likely involves Python and Docker, and the user is working in a directory in their Downloads folder.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a screenshot of a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) window.  VS Code is a popular integrated development environment (IDE).

**Key Panels/Sections:**

1.  **Explorer Panel (Left):**  This panel displays the file system structure of a project named "llmagent". It shows the files and folders within the project.

    *   **Files/Folders:**
        *   `.env`: Likely contains environment variables.
        *   `app.py`
        *   `datagen.py`
        *   `Dockerfile`
        *   `evaluate.py`
        *   `LICENSE`
        *   `readme.md`
        *   `tasksA.py`
        *   `tasksB.py`

2.  **Editor Panel (Center/Top-Right):** The editor shows the content of the `.env` file. The content looks like this:

    *   `.env` file content:
        *   `AIPROXY_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6IjIzZjIwMDEzOTBAZHMuc3R1ZHku` This seems to be a sensitive API token.

3.  **Terminal Panel (Bottom):** This panel shows the terminal output from running a `git clone` command.

    *   **Git Clone Command:** `git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent`
    *   **Terminal Output:**
        *   The terminal indicates that the git clone operation was successful:
            *   Cloning into 'llmagent'
            *   Enumerating objects
            *   Counting objects
            *   Compressing objects
            *   Receiving Objects
            *   Resolving deltas
            *   All steps reported as 100% done.

**Key Information/Observations:**

*   **Project Name:** "llmagent"
*   **Environment Variable:** The `.env` file contains an API token named `AIPROXY_TOKEN`. This token is likely used for authentication or authorization with a service.  **It's important to note that exposing API tokens in images is a security risk.**
*   **Git Repository:** The project is being cloned from a GitHub repository located at `https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent`.
*   **Programming Languages:** The presence of `.py` files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksA.py`, `tasksB.py`) indicates that the project likely involves Python programming.
*   **Docker:** The `Dockerfile` suggests that the project can be containerized using Docker.
*   **File Paths:** The terminal output reveals the user's file path.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on anything!
 Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of a code editor, specifically Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It shows the interface with a project open, focusing on a Python file.

**Left Pane (Explorer):**

*   **Title:** "EXPLORER"
*   **Project Structure:** This section shows the file and folder structure of the project named "llmagent." The structure includes:
    *   `.env` (Likely a directory for environment variables)
    *   `app.py`
    *   `datagen.py`
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `evaluate.py`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `readme.md`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`
*   The file "evaluate.py" is selected/highlighted.

**Center Pane (Code Editor):**

        *   `from lxml.html import fromstring`
        *   `from PIL import Image`
    *   **API Keys:** Defines variables for API keys:
        *   `openai_api_key = "eyJhbGciOiJIUZI1NiJ9.eyJlb"` (Likely incomplete for security)
        *   `gemini_api_key = {"AIzaSyAco2n8bokG1wXN6PTMI"` (Likely incomplete for security)

**Bottom Pane:**

*   **OUTLINE:** This is part of the VS Code interface, likely showing a summary of the code structure.
*   **OPEN EDITORS:** Lists the open files, including `.env` and `evaluate.py`.
*   **TIMELINE:** Another panel.

**Other details:**

*   Dark theme of VS Code is used.

**Overall Impression:**

The code snippet is part of a Python project that likely involves data generation, text processing, image manipulation, and integration with external services (indicated by the API keys). It seems focused on extracting various data points from text, based on the functions imported from `datagen`.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on details that are potentially useful for question answering:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image shows a code editor, specifically Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
*   There are two main panels:
    *   **Explorer Panel (Left):**  This shows a file directory structure.
    *   **Editor Panel (Right):**  This displays the contents of a specific file.

**Explorer Panel (Left Side):**

*   **Folder Structure:** The root folder is named "llmagent".  It contains several files and possibly subfolders (though not expanded).
*   **Files (within "llmagent"):**
    *   `.env` (likely environment variables file) - Marked with "U", potentially indicating "Unsaved changes".
    *   `app.py` (selected/highlighted)
    *   `datagen.py` - Marked with "M" indicating it has been modified.
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `evaluate.py` - Marked with "M" indicating it has been modified.
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `readme.md`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`

**Editor Panel (Right Side):**

*   **File:**  The file being displayed is `app.py`.
*   **Code (Comments):** The visible code consists entirely of comments.
    *   Line 1: `# app.py`
    *   Line 2: `# /// script`
    *   Line 3: `# dependencies = [`
    *   Lines 4-15: A list of commented-out dependencies, including:
        *   `"requests"`
        *   `"fastapi"`
        *   `"uvicorn"`
        *   `"python-dateutil"`
        *   `"pandas"`
        *   `"db-sqlite3"`
        *   `"scipy"`
        *   `"pybase64"`
        *   `"python-dotenv"`
        *   `"httpx"`
        *   `"markdown"`
        *   `"duckdb"`
    *   Line 16: `# ]`  (closing bracket for the list)
    *   Line 17: `# ///`

**Key Observations:**

*   The `app.py` file currently consists only of comments, including a commented-out list of Python dependencies.
*   The "M" indicators next to `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py` suggest these files have been modified but not saved.
*   The "U" indicator next to `.env` indicates it is unsaved.

This level of detail should be helpful for answering a wide variety of questions about the image.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image displays a screenshot of a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) window. VS Code is a popular code editor.
*   The layout is divided into three main sections:
    *   **Explorer (Left):** Shows the project file structure.
    *   **Editor (Center):** Displays the contents of a selected file (in this case, "app.py").
    *   **Terminal (Bottom):** Shows command-line output, specifically related to building a Docker image.

**File Explorer (Left):**

*   The project is named "llmagent".
*   The files and folders within the project are listed:
    *   `.env`
    *   `app.py` (currently open in the editor)
    *   `datagen.py`
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `evaluate.py`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `readme.md`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`

**Code Editor (Center):**

*   The open file is `app.py`.
*   The code snippet shows a Python script.
*   It appears to be defining a list of dependencies required for the project. These dependencies include:
    *   "requests"
    *   "fastapi"
    *   "uvicorn"
    *   "python-dateutil"
    *   "pandas"
    *   "db-sqlite3"
    *   "scipy"
    *   "pybase64"

**Terminal (Bottom):**

*   The terminal is running PowerShell.
*   The current directory is: `C:\Users\USER\Downloads\Wiew folder (33)\llmagent`
*   The command executed is: `docker build -t llm-agent .`  This command initiates the building of a Docker image.
*   The terminal output displays the steps involved in the Docker image build process:
    *   Loading the Dockerfile.
    *   Transferring the Dockerfile.
    *   Loading metadata for the base image (python:3.12-slim-bookworm).
    *   Authenticating with the Docker registry.
    *   Loading the `.dockerignore` file.
    *   Transferring the build context.
    *   Pulling the base image (python:3.12-slim-bookworm).
    *   Adding an installation script.
    *   Updating and installing packages using `apt-get`.
    *   Installing Python packages using `pip` (fastapi, uvicorn, requests, etc. - these match the dependencies listed in `app.py`).
    *   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
    *   Copying the Python files (`*.py`) and the `.env` file into the image.
    *   Exporting the image and layers.
    *   Naming the image `docker.io/library/llm-agent`.
*   The build process is indicated as being "FINISHED" successfully.

**Other Features:**

*   In the bottom right corner, the text “docker:desktop-lim” can be seen.
*   The `OUTLINE` and `OPEN EDITORS` sections are collapsed in the lower left, though the list of open editors can still be seen.

**In summary:** The image shows a developer working on a Python project within VS Code. The project involves setting up dependencies and building a Docker image for the application. The Docker build process appears to have completed successfully.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on relevant text, objects, and features:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image shows the VS Code IDE, with a file explorer, code editor, and terminal panel. The file explorer shows a project directory named "llmagent" with several files, including `.env`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, etc.

**Code Editor Panel:**

*   The file `.env` is open in the code editor.
*   Line 1 contains the environment variable: `AIPROXY_TOKEN=eyJhb6ciOiJIUzI1Ni39.ey3lbWFpbCI6IjIzZjIwMDEzOTBAZHMuc3R1ZHkuaklebsshYy5pbi39.MFOFVD2AwbfhpaVtd5X2LgZEidgCmJ8aRy1qWt5Y2RE` This looks like a JWT (JSON Web Token) or a similar encoded string, commonly used for authentication.

**Terminal Panel:**

*   The terminal panel displays the output of a command: `uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000`.
*   It appears to be running a Python script named `evaluate.py` using the `uv` command.
*   The script is receiving several arguments, including an email address (`23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`), a token counter, and an external port number (8000).
*   There are messages indicating tasks being run: "Running task: Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sanande/f19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a/raw/13246698088795e1942179856aafd466052b66ae/datagen.py`". This suggests the script is downloading and executing code from a GitHub Gist URL.
*   There's an HTTP POST request being made to `http://localhost:8000/run`. The query parameters seem to encode task details.
*   There's an HTTP 400 error with the message `"detail": "name 'HTTPException' is not defined"`. This indicates an exception handling problem in the code being executed on the server.
*   There's an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md` which returns an HTTP 200 OK status.
*   There are messages indicating the status of certain checks or tests:
    *   "A1 PASSED"
    *   "A2 failed: \[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified" (This is an OS error).
    *   "A2 FAILED"

    *   "Running task: '/data/datefile.txt' has list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Thursdays in the list and write just the number to '/data/dates-thursdays.txt'"

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image captures a debugging session in VS Code. A Python script, `evaluate.py`, is being run, which in turn downloads and executes another script from a GitHub Gist.  The script interacts with a local server on port 8000.  There are issues with the server-side code (HTTPException not defined) and file access (WinError 2). The script is likely evaluating code related to data generation and date processing, with checks A1 and A2 indicating the results of certain validation steps.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout and Environment:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a code editor, likely VS Code, showing a project called "llmagent".
*   The left pane shows the project's file structure, including folders and individual files like "app.py," "datagen.py," ".env," etc.
*   The central area displays the content of a file. In the top-right part, it seems to be the content of the ".env" file, showing an `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.
*   The bottom pane displays a "Terminal" window, showing the execution of a script and debugging information.

**Code and File Structure (Left Pane):**

*   The project directory "llmagent" is expanded, revealing its contents.
*   Key files include: ".env", "app.py," "datagen.py," "Dockerfile," "evaluate.py," "LICENSE," "readme.md," "tasksA.py," and "tasksB.py".
*   A folder named "_pycache__" is also present, which typically contains compiled Python bytecode files.

**".env" File Content (Top-Right):**

*   The AIPROXY\_TOKEN appears to be a long string, probably an API key in JWT (JSON Web Token) format. It starts with "eyJ" which is typical for base64 encoded JSON.

**Terminal Output (Bottom Pane):**

*   **Task Description:** The task being executed is "Does the statement 'I hate you' have a positive or negative connotation? Reply as a single string containing either 'POSITIIVE' or 'NEGATIVE' in uppercase. Save the result to /data/c5.txt"
*   **HTTP Request/Response (Errors):**
    *   A "POST" request to `http://localhost:8000/run` resulted in an "HTTP 400 Bad Request" error. The request parameters are visible in the URL, showing how the task instructions were sent to the server.
    *   The "detail" in the HTTP 400 response is: `"detail": "No connection adapters were found for 'data:text/plain; charset=utf-8, NEGATIVE'"` suggesting an issue with how the data is being sent or handled.
*   **HTTP Request/Response (Success):**
    *   A "GET" request to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/c5.txt` returned an "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".
*   **Test Result (Failure):**
    *   The expected result for `/data/c5.txt` was "NEGATIVE".
    *   The actual result was `[('NEGATIVE',)]`. It suggests the actual result contains additional characters that differ from the expected result.
*   **Task Status:**
    *   "C4 FAILED" and "C5 FAILED"
*   **Score:** The overall score is "6 / 25", indicating that the script is not performing well.
*   **Another HTTP Request:** There is a POST request to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`

**General Observations:**

*   The program is likely interacting with a local server (localhost:8000) to execute tasks.
*   It also interacts with a remote server (aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev) to get embeddings.
*   The Python script is failing to correctly answer the sentiment analysis question, leading to a failed test case.
*   The `data:text/plain` error suggests an issue with the encoding or data format being used when sending results back to the server.

Yes,the Same case happend to me also we have put lot of efforts in this project but after seeing that in mail you have no mit licence, I added that license but with name of mit license actually to just name that license file as MIT license but due to this all our hardwork is just an experience but actually we are not awarding any marks in project1 . I request the TDS team to consider this issue.

I have passed the pre requisites, but there is no log file for my email.

At least docker logs should be there, right?

Was it missed by any chance?

Respected Sir , @carlton @Jivraj  
My roll number is 23f3001688  
Pls check my repository properly because I have dockerfile in my repo but it is mentioned that it is not present.  
Here is my repository link and screenshot for your reference sir and the dockerfile is present sir

github.com

### GitHub - Sharmilecholan/tds\_project1

Contribute to Sharmilecholan/tds\_project1 development by creating an account on GitHub.

I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is “dockerfile” and you have mentioned it as “Dockerfile” . So is it a mistake to put “D” in lowercase.  
Kindly look into this sir because of this I got 0 in project 1 even though many of the tasks of my projects passed the evaluation test.

Regards,  
S Sharmile

WhatsApp Image 2025-04-07 at 15.39.10\_edb0b829720×1600 125 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on the text and relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a mobile phone screen displaying an error log or output from a programming script.  The interface is dark with light-colored text, suggesting a terminal or code editor. The log indicates a problem with a datasette task involving database queries and file operations.

**Key Elements and Their Interpretation:**

1.  **Top Area:**

    *   `15:37`:  Time stamp (3:37 PM).
    *   `22f3000276@ds.s...`:  Likely an email address or a unique identifier associated with the task or user.
    *   Signal strength icons and battery level indicator at the top right.

2.  **Error Messages:**

    *   `X 89 FAILED`:  Indicates that task number 89 failed.  The "X" visually confirms the failure.
    *   `Running task: Run datasette via 'uvx' datasette ...`:  Describes the task being executed. It involves running a `datasette` command using `uvx`, a tool for managing datasets. The dataset file is `/data/ticket-sales.db`, and it is running on port 8001.

3.  **Database Query:**

    *   `From 'tickets' count the number of rows where type is "Bronze" using http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT COUNT(*) FROM+tickets+WHERE+type+=%22Bronze%22`:  Specifies a SQL query intended to count the number of rows in a table named "tickets" where the "type" column has the value "Bronze". The query is being passed to the datasette server via a URL. The `%22` is URL encoding for double quotes.

4.  **File Operation:**

    *   `and save it to /data/b10.csv.` and `Then stop the datasette server.`: This describes that the output of the SQL Query is to be saved to `/data/b10.csv` and then, stop the datasette server.

5.  **HTTP Requests and Responses:**

    *   `HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8134/run?... "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error"`:  A POST request to the `localhost` URL with a path `8134/run?` failed, resulting in an "Internal Server Error" (HTTP 500).  The encoded parameters in the URL likely describe the datasette task to be executed. The long string of URL-encoded characters after `/run?` is essentially a serialized representation of the task (running datasette with a specific database and query).
    *   `HTTP 500 { "detail": "*filename*" }`: The detailed error message of the HTTP 500 error. Filename is the issue.
    *   `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8134/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"`: A GET request to read the file `/data/b10.csv` failed with a "Not Found" error (HTTP 404).
    *   `B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv`:  A specific message indicating that the attempt to read the file `/data/b10.csv` failed.

6.  **Task Status and Score:**

    *   `X B10 FAILED`: Another confirmation that action related to B10 failed.
    *   `Score: 9 / 20`:  A score or progress indication, likely related to the completion of the overall task or assessment.

7.  **Final HTTP Request:**

    *   `HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`: A POST request to an API endpoint related to AI embeddings (likely for a service like OpenAI). The status code "200 OK" indicates that this request was successful.

**Summary of the Problem:**

The primary issue is that the datasette task failed. The SQL query was likely executed, but the result could not be saved to the file `/data/b10.csv`, or the server may have not saved the file correctly. A subsequent attempt to read this file resulted in a "Not Found" error.  This indicates either a problem with the file path, file permissions, or the file not being created correctly in the first place. The `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` suggests that there may be an issue with the datasette server.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a grading or evaluation report for a programming project submission. It displays scores, pre-requisite checks, and other submission details. The interface seems to be within a mobile app or mobile web page, given the status bar icons at the top. The content is primarily text-based with some simple tabular data.

**Top Section:**

*   **"15:37"**:  A timestamp indicating the time the screenshot was taken.
*   **"outliers do not influence the scores"**: A statement indicating that outlier scores do not skew the overall results.
*   **"Your final t score calculation is based on MIN (20, (task score + bonus))"**:  This details how the final 't' score is calculated, taking the minimum of 20 and the sum of the task score and bonus.

**Submission Details:**

*   **"Github repo submitted:"**:  A link to a GitHub repository: `https://github.com/anshiraj07/TDS-Project-1-2025`.
*   **"Docker repo submitted:"**:  An identifier for the Docker repository: `22f3000276/task-agent`.

**Pre-requisites Check:**

This section outlines conditions that the submission must meet for a "pass" status. Each successful condition is indicated by a "1", while a failure would be a "0".

*   **"Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1"**: Indicates that the Docker repository exists, is public, and has a timestamp before February 18th (year not specified). The value '1' shows it passes the check.
*   **"Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1"**: Indicates that the Github repository exists, is public, and has a timestamp before February 18th (year not specified). The value '1' shows it passes the check.
*   **"Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1"**:  Confirms that a license file (either "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.md") is present in the GitHub repository, implying it uses the MIT License. The value '1' shows it passes the check.
*   **"Gihub repo check-Dockerfile exists: 1"**: Confirms that a Dockerfile exists in the Github repository. The value '1' shows it passes the check.

**Score Grids (A, B, C):**

These are likely evaluation grids or rubrics related to the task. The grids are labeled A1-A10, B1-B10, and C1-C5. All cells in these grids contain the value "0", indicating that the submission has not scored points in any of the relevant areas represented by these grid cells.

**Scores:**

*   **"Your task score is: 0"**: The core task score is 0.
*   **"Your bonus is: 1"**: A bonus of 1 point has been awarded.
*   **"Your P1 score is: 1"**:  There is a score called the P1 score and it is 1.

**Additional Information/Instructions:**

*   **"We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites. You will only have an evaluation log if your API service actually started working within 5 minutes. Otherwise you will have only a docker log."**:  Explains the availability of logs. Evaluation logs are provided only if the API service started within 5 minutes; otherwise, only Docker logs are available.
*   **"The evaluate.py and datagen.py that was used for the tasks has also been shared for your own learning. If you want to diagnose any issues, please make sure"**: Mention that `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` were used and shared for learning.

**Key Observations:**

*   The submission met all pre-requisites.
*   The "task score" is low (0), but a bonus point was given.
*   More information about the specific criteria represented in the score grids (A, B, C) would be necessary to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the submission.
*   The logs (Docker or Evaluation) would be crucial for diagnosing any problems with the submission.

In essence, this image represents an automated evaluation report of a programming project submission. While the submission passed initial checks, the lack of points in the main task scoring section indicates potential issues.

@jivraj

earlier I built the project inside app folder so it was

```
COPY app /app

```

it should have been

```
COPY . /app

```

Is there anything that can be done on your end now?  
All the code is there.

Dear @carlton

This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the  
`/app/app/main.py` file is missing. However, in my project directory, the  
`main.py` file is located in the `app/` folder, and the `run.py` file is in the root folder of the project, which is `LLM_Automation_Agent` . This structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py`.

To run the project, the command I used is:

```
python run.py

```

Since `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to `app/main.py`.

I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder (`llm-automation-agent`).

For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

Here is the GitHub link to my project:

github.com

### GitHub - ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent

    *   It also shows log entries, with timestamps, indicating HTTP requests and responses.
    *   There are log lines with status codes "200" and descriptions such as "Counted WEDSnesdays".
*   **Bottom Console:** At the very bottom of the screen, there is a console log with the message `"message": "Counted WEDSnesdays in detailsData.txt", "status": "success"`.

**Bottom Section (Web Browser):**

*   **GitHub Repository:** A web browser (likely Chrome) displays a GitHub repository page.
    *   The repository is named `elm-automation-agent`.
    *   The repository has files such as `elm`, `docs`, `LICENSE.txt`, `docker`, `experiences.elm`, `README.md`, etc.
    *   It includes commit history information, a 'Create New Issue' button, and package/language information.

**Key Observations:**

*   The developer is working on a project related to credit card automation and specifically counting instances of "WEDSnesdays" within data (potentially from a text file).
*   The project is using Python and Flask.
*   The source code is managed in a GitHub repository called `elm-automation-agent`.

**In Summary:**

The image provides a snapshot of a developer's workflow, illustrating the process of developing, testing, and version-controlling code related to credit card automation and data analysis.

Same here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received.  
The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb.  
Sir, I would highly appreciate if you consider it as the rest of the pre-requisites are working well.Due to this, the project is also not being evaulated.  
Thankyou

Just checked right now. I am getting this error.

Replicate test environment following this post.  
Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies - Courses / Tools in Data Science - IITM-DSA0
The image shows a terminal window displaying command-line interactions. 

First, the user runs `docker images | grep "22f3002902"`. This command lists docker images and filters the output to only show lines containing "22f3002902". The output indicates that an image with the tag "latest" and ID "c739ff8a3247" was found, created 6 days ago, and has a size of 1.13GB.

Next, the user attempts to run a docker container using the command `docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 c739ff8a3247`. This command runs a container based on the image with the ID "c739ff8a3247," setting the environment variable AIPROXY_TOKEN and mapping port 8000 of the host to port 8000 of the container.

However, the container fails to start due to an error.  The error message `python: can't open file '/app/app/main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory` indicates that the Python interpreter within the container cannot find the file `/app/app/main.py`.  This suggests that either the file is missing from the image or that the working directory within the container is not set correctly.

I am facing Npx error... can I know what went wrong?
@carlton @Jivraj
```
Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Content:**

The image depicts a standard hazard symbol. It consists of the following:

*   **Shape:** A bright yellow equilateral triangle.
*   **Symbol:** Inside the triangle, there's a large black exclamation mark (!). The exclamation mark is positioned vertically and centered within the triangle.
*   **Background:** The background is solid black, which creates a high contrast and makes the hazard symbol stand out prominently.
*   **Pixelated:** The image is noticeably pixelated.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a clear and recognizable warning sign, commonly used to indicate potential dangers or hazards. The pixelation suggests the image might be a screenshot or a low-resolution version.
 Okay, let's analyze the image.

The image shows a red "X" mark. 

**Key Features:**

*   **Shape:** The prominent feature is the "X" shape.
*   **Color:** The "X" is red.
*   **Stylization:** The "X" has rounded ends and appears to have a slight "glow" or highlight, giving it a somewhat cartoonish or emoji-like appearance.
*   **Background:** The background is black.

**Possible Interpretations/Uses:**

*   A visual symbol for "no," "incorrect," "cancel," "delete," "close," or "error."
*   Might be used as a button icon in a user interface.
*   Could represent the result of an incorrect answer, deletion, or a negative action.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any aspect or speculate on the image's use in a specific context!

> ```
> I am facing Npx error... can I know what went wrong?
>
> ```

This `npx` error is originating from your Docker container—it’s not being generated by our script. Try to look for what caused this error.
Here is a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a candid shot of a woman in an outdoor setting, possibly a park or garden. The background is slightly blurred, suggesting the focus is on the subject.

**Subject Description:**

*   **Gender:** Female
*   **Hair:** Dark, long hair.
*   **Clothing:** She is wearing a dark-colored jacket or coat.
*   **Action/Pose:** She seems to be adjusting her jacket or fiddling with something in the front.

**Background:**

*   **Setting:** The backdrop contains elements suggesting an outdoor environment. There are trees and foliage.
*   **Blur:** The background is out of focus, emphasizing the subject.

**Additional Details:**

*   The lighting seems natural, possibly from daylight.

If you have specific questions you'd like answered, please feel free to ask.

My code uses `npx` to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via `subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...])`, which assumes that `npx` is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or `npx`, this results in an error during evaluation.

To test the functionality correctly, `npx` must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:

bash: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm`

Once installed, `npx prettier@3.4.2` should work as expected.

For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where `npx` is available by default.

@Jivraj @carlton  
Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks. I also built the Docker image as required.  
But, when you gus evaluated , I get the following error:docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: “uvicorn”: executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.  
Could you please help me understand why this is happening even though the evaluation script ran fine?

**Overall Impression:**

The image presents a repository's "General" information in Docker Hub. The repository "hilalazeez/llm-automation-agent" has one tag ("latest"), some vulnerabilities, and was last pushed about 2 months ago. The right-hand side promotes using Buildcloud for building Docker images.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web page, likely a documentation page generated by the FastAPI framework for a Python API. It displays available API endpoints (routes) and schema definitions.

**Key Elements & Text:**

*   **Title:** "FastAPI".  Next to it are the versions "0.1.0" and "OAS 3.1" (likely referring to OpenAPI Specification version).

*   **Navigation/Menu:** At the very top, near the browser address bar, are browser tabs and bookmarks: "Import favorites", "Out of the box", "Meet the Rubik's Cu" , "Lenovo Support", "Lenovo", "McAfee" and "New tab". The address bar shows the URL "127.0.0.1:0000/docs/".

*   **API Endpoints (Routes):** A section labeled "default" lists the available API endpoints.
    *   "GET /ask Ask": Indicates a GET request to the "/ask" endpoint, presumably for asking a question.
    *   "POST /run Run Task": Indicates a POST request to the "/run" endpoint, likely for running a task. The visual appearance suggests this section may be highlighted in green.
    *   "GET /read Read File": Indicates a GET request to the "/read" endpoint, probably for reading a file.

*   **Schemas:** A section labeled "Schemas" lists the data models used in the API.
    *   "HTTPValidationError > Expand all object": Likely indicates a schema for HTTP validation errors.  The "> Expand all" implies it can be expanded to see the details of the schema.
    *   "ValidationError > Expand all object": Likely indicates a schema for general validation errors, also expandable.

*   **Visual Cues:**
    *   Each API endpoint listing appears to have an expandable/collapsible section (indicated by the down arrow icon).
    *   The endpoints are styled with different background colors based on the HTTP method (GET or POST).

**Interpretation:**

The image is a documentation page, automatically generated by FastAPI, that allows developers to explore and test the API. It shows the available endpoints, the HTTP methods used, and provides information about the data structures (schemas) involved.

**In summary:** The image depicts automatically generated documentation for a FastAPI API, displaying its endpoints, methods, and schemas. It's a user-friendly way for developers to understand and interact with the API.

idk why i am doing this but this is my last request (for evaluation) with proofs. me and my friend both have same docker file code with missing flask dependency (i will try as much to not reveal his id/name) he got 12/20 even tough i tried same methods given by you and same error popped up flask module not found in his case but you gave him 12/20 marks but for me you gave 0? did i done something wrong? I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters. i am also uploading his docker file image and mine with 0 commits after 18th feb.

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall View:**

The image is a screenshot of a code editor, likely a web-based one like GitHub's code view. It shows a file named "Dockerfile" open within a file directory structure.

**Code Editor Area:**

*   **File Navigation:** On the left side, there's a file explorer displaying a directory structure with folders (e.g., `_pycache_`, `data`, `.env`) and individual files (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`, `tasksApy`, `tasksB.py`). The file `Dockerfile` is currently selected, implying that its content is displayed in the code editing area.
*   **Dockerfile Content:** The main part of the image displays the content of the `Dockerfile`. This file contains instructions for building a Docker image. The code includes various commands like `FROM`, `RUN`, `ADD`, `pip install`, `ENV`, `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, and `EXPOSE`. It sets up dependencies, installs Python packages, sets environment variables, copies files, exposes ports, and defines the command to run when the container starts.
*   **Code Analysis Indicators:** Above the code, there's text indicating some code analysis features. It mentions "30 lines (22 loc) · 910 Bytes" which signifies the file's length. It also says "Code 55% faster with GitHub Copilot" suggesting that GitHub's Copilot AI assistant is being used.

**Dockerfile Details:**

Here are some key commands and actions found in the `Dockerfile` code:

*   `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm`: Specifies the base image for the Docker container (Python 3.12 slim version).
*   `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install ...`: Installs system dependencies.
*   `ADD https://astral.sh/ww/install.sh /vv-installer.sh`: Downloads a script for `ww` installation
*   `RUN pip install ...`: Installs various Python packages like `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`, `scipy`, etc.
*   `ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"`: Sets the environment PATH variable.
*   `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container.
*   `COPY ./app`: Copies the application files.
*   `EXPOSE 8000`: Exposes port 8000.
*   `CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]`: Defines the command to start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn.

**Image Artifacts:**

*   **Blurred Areas:** Certain portions of the image (likely usernames, project names, or other sensitive information) have been blurred out.
*   **Annotation:** There's a handwritten text "seiend" (likely intended to be "friend" with a typo) with an arrow pointing near the "Code 55% faster" text. This annotation seems to be either personal or a part of a discussion about the file and its coding efficiency.

In short, the image depicts a Dockerfile being edited, along with the surrounding file structure and code analysis information, likely within a GitHub interface.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout**

The image shows a screenshot of a code repository interface, likely from GitHub. It displays code from a file called "Dockerfile" within a project named "TDS_Project_1."

**Left Panel**

*   **File Explorer:** The left side of the interface is a file explorer, displaying the project's directory structure.
    *   Visible directories/files include:
        *   `._pycache_.` (Likely a Python cache directory)
        *   `data`
        *   `Dockerfile` (Currently selected, as indicated by highlighting)
        *   `LICENSE`
        *   `README.md`
        *   `app.py`
        *   `datagen.py`
        *   `evaluate.py`
        *   `tasksA.py`
        *   `tasksB.py`

*   **Branch Selection:** There's a dropdown menu at the top of the file explorer, set to "main," indicating the current branch being viewed.

**Main Content Area**

*   **File Header:** The top of the main area shows the project path: "TDS\_Project\_1 / Dockerfile."
*   **Commit Information:** Below the path, there's information about the last commit: "23/11000879 Added Dockerfile."
*   **Code View:** The main content area displays the code of the "Dockerfile."
    *   **Code Type:** At the top left says 'code'
    *   **Line Count:** "30 lines (22 loc) 910 Bytes" gives a count of lines of code in the file
*   **Github Copilot:** The text "Code 55% faster with Github Copilot" indicates that Github Copilot is enabled
*   **Dockerfile Contents:**
    *   The code is a Dockerfile, written for building a containerized application. It contains instructions for:
        *   Using Python 3.12 slim version as a base image
        *   Installing system dependencies (required for Scipy and other libraries)
        *   Installing uv
        *   Installing Python packages (fastapi, uvicorn, python-dateutil, requests, scipy, python-dotenv, httpx, pandas, db-sqlite3, pybase64, markdown, duckdb)
        *   Ensuring the installed binary is on the "PATH"
        *   Setting up the application directory
        *   Copying application files
        *   Exposing port 8000
        *   Starting the FastAPI server

**Top Navigation**

*   The top of the screen shows the GitHub navigation menu, including options like:
    *   `<> Code` (currently selected)
    *   `Issues`
    *   `Pull requests`
    *   `Actions`
    *   `Projects`
    *   `Wiki`
    *   `Security`
    *   `Insights`
    *   `Settings`

**Annotation**

There is a white handwritten arrow pointing to the 'Code 55% faster with Github Copilot' text with the text 'mine'.

**In Summary**

The image presents the code of a Dockerfile within a GitHub repository, showing how a Python-based application is being containerized. The Dockerfile includes instructions for installing dependencies, setting up the environment, and starting the application.

Dear Sirs,  
@Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini @carlton

As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.

Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513805×197 9.52 KB

**Github repo submitted:** GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent  
**Docker repo submitted:** wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent

The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the `app.py` file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.

I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the `app.py` file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:  
https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py.  
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent.

Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.

I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.

Thank You and Regards,

Here's a breakdown of the content of the image:

**Overall Content:**

The image is a screenshot of instructions, likely for a software development or deployment task. The instructions involve creating, publishing, and running a Docker image.

**Textual Elements (and their likely meaning):**

*   **"Create a Dockerfile that builds your application"**: This is the first instruction, directing the user to create a Dockerfile that defines the steps for building the application.
*   **"Publish your Docker image publicly to Docker Hub"**: The second instruction tells the user to upload the Docker image to Docker Hub, a public registry. Publishing publicly means anyone can access the image.
*   **"Ensure that running your image via"**: This sets the stage for providing a command to run the Docker image.
*   **`podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME automatically serves the API at http://localhost:8000/run?task=... and http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`**: This is a command-line instruction.
    *   `podman run`:  Indicates the use of Podman (a container engine) to run the image.
    *   `--rm`:  Suggests that the container should be removed after it exits.
    *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`: Sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the value of `$AIPROXY_TOKEN`.
    *   `-p 8000:8000`:  Maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 in the container.
    *   `$IMAGE_NAME`: A placeholder for the name of the Docker image.
    *   `automatically serves the API at...`:  This indicates that running the image will automatically start an API.
    *   `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`: These are example URLs indicating the API's endpoints. The "... " implies that there are additional parameters after 'task=' and 'path='.
*   **"Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository"**:  This tells the user to submit the URL of their GitHub repository in a Google Form.
*   **(https://github.com/user-name/repo-name) and your Docker image name (user-name/repo-name )**: This is an example URL for a GitHub repository, as well as an example of the format of the Docker image name the user needs to submit. The user would replace 'user-name' and 'repo-name' with their actual GitHub username and repository name.

@carlton @Jivraj  
Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.

image1298×857 29.4 KB

I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…  
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:  
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.  

image1027×510 11 KB

  
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

Thank you.  
Regards,  
Shivaditya
The image shows a Python traceback. The error `OSError: cannot open resource` occurs when the program tries to load fonts using the PIL (Pillow) library.

The traceback indicates that the issue happens in the file `/tmp/datagen66arSL.py` within the function `a8_credit_card_image`. It fails when trying to create an `ImageFont` object with a specified font and size using `ImageFont.truetype()`.

The error happens twice, with the first one when trying to use "arial.ttf" and the second time when trying to use "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf". This suggests that the program is trying to load a font file that cannot be found or accessed by the program.

The traceback also points to the PIL library's files within the Python environment, suggesting that the issue isn't necessarily in the program's code, but rather a problem with the font file paths or access permissions.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image shows Python code.  It appears to be a script designed for some kind of data processing or file manipulation, likely related to email, logs, documentation, and potentially financial data (credit card, ticket sales). The first print statement is a disclaimer that the script is subject to change during an evaluation. The second print statement informs the user where the files are created, which is based on a user-provided root directory.

**Code Details:**

1.  **Shebang (Implied):** It's likely the code is intended to be run as a script, so there might be a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) at the top, although it is not visible.

2.  **`if __name__ == "__main__":`:** This is a standard Python construct to ensure the code inside the block only runs when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module).

3.  **`import argparse`:** This imports the `argparse` module, used for parsing command-line arguments.

4.  **Argument Parsing:**
    *   `parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()`: Creates an `ArgumentParser` object.
    *   `parser.add_argument("email")`:  Adds a required argument named "email".
    *   `parser.add_argument("--root", default="/data")`: Adds an optional argument named "--root". It has a default value of "/data".
    *   `args = parser.parse_args()`: Parses the arguments provided when the script is run.

5.  **Configuration:**
    *   `config["email"] = args.email`: The value provided for the "email" argument is stored in a dictionary called "config" under the key "email".
    *   `config["root"] = os.path.abspath(args.root)`: This gets the absolute path of the "root" argument (which could be "/data" or a user-specified path) and stores it in the `config` dictionary under the key "root". The `os.path.abspath()` function ensures that the path is absolute.

6.  **Directory Creation:**
    *   `os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)`: This creates a directory (or directories) based on the path stored in `config["root"]`. `exist_ok=True` prevents an error if the directory already exists.

7.  **Print Statements:**
    *   `print("DISCLAIMER: THIS SCRIPT WILL CHANGE BEFORE THE EVALUATION. TREAT THIS AS A GUIDE.")`:  A disclaimer about the script's development status.
    *   `print("Files created at", config["root"])`: Informs the user of where the directory was created.

8.  **Function Calls:**
    *   A series of function calls suggest that the script performs various tasks related to different data types:
        *   `a2_format_markdown()`
        *   `a3_dates()`
        *   `a4_contacts()`
        *   `a5_logs()`
        *   `a6_docs()`
        *   `a7_email()`
        *   `a8_credit_card_image()`
        *   `a9_comments()`
        *   `a10_ticket_sales()`

**Inference and Possible Functionality:**

Based on the code, here's what we can infer:

*   The script likely collects data, possibly from various sources, including email, logs, documents, images, and perhaps even data related to credit cards and ticket sales.
*   It formats some of the data into Markdown (`a2_format_markdown`).
*   It extracts dates, contacts, and potentially performs some analysis or organization of this data.
*   The `config` dictionary likely holds settings that are used by various parts of the script. The root directory is determined by the command-line arguments and is used to store output files.

In summary, this is a Python script that is designed to perform a variety of tasks related to processing and organizing different types of data, including emails, logs, documentation, and potentially financial data. It uses command-line arguments for configuration and creates a directory to store the processed data.

Hi Haricharan

Your Dockerfile does not build the repo. Its misconfigured.  
This is the error when building it:

```

```

Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 11.12.18 am754×302 41 KB

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.  
Therefore it does not build.  
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.  
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Kind regards
The image contains lines of code, likely from a Dockerfile or similar configuration file. The first line is a comment: "# Set up the application directory". The next line, "WORKDIR /app", sets the working directory for the application to "/app". Then there is another comment: "# Copy application files". The following line, "COPY *.py /app/", copies all Python files (files ending with ".py") to the "/app/" directory. Finally, the last line "COPY .env /app/" copies the ".env" file to the "/app/" directory. The lines are displayed in a monospace font, with keywords in yellow and comments in grey. An orange arrow and rectangle emphasizes this final line of code.

docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "uv": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown

```

Thats why we cannot evaluate it.

There is **clearly** *some difference* between both the applications. That is up to you to figure out. I can only tell whats wrong with yours. After building it and trying to run it this is the error we get. It fails to run as a result and we cannot evaluate it.

Hi,

Please let me know the reason on why I have not got any bonus marks.

image1310×681 14.5 KB

image1696×732 59.5 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout and Purpose:**

The image appears to be an output from a system or script that evaluates a student's project or assignment. It presents information about the project's files, their accessibility, and automated checks performed.  It ends with some numerical scores.

**Textual Elements:**

*   **Title:** "Your final t score calculation is based on MIN (20, (task score + bonus))" This indicates that the final score is capped at 20 and calculated as the minimum between 20 and the sum of the "task score" and "bonus."
*   **Repository Information:**
    *   "Github repo submitted: https://github.com/swati-iitm/project1\_final" Provides the URL of the submitted GitHub repository.
    *   "Docker repo submitted: swatiiitm/project1\_final" Indicates the name of the submitted Docker repository.
*   **Pre-requisites Check:**
    *   "Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)" This sets the stage for a series of checks, where 1 signifies a pass and 0 signifies a fail.
    *   The checks are:
        *   "Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1"
        *   "Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1"
        *   "Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1"
        *   "Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1"
*   **Scores:**
    *   "Your task score is: 3"
    *   "Your bonus is: 0"
    *   "Your P1 score is: 4"

**Tables (Grids of Numbers):**

*   There are three tables with labeled rows (A, B, C) and columns (1-10 for rows A and B, 1-5 for row C).
*   The cells within these tables contain numerical values, either 0 or 1. These most likely indicate the results of additional automated checks or tests.

**In Summary:**

The image presents a report of a student's project evaluation. It includes checks for the existence and validity of the GitHub and Docker repositories, the presence of essential files (LICENSE, Dockerfile), and various automated tests reflected in the grid of numbers. Finally, it presents the task score, bonus, and P1 score.
 Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on the content visible in a typical GitHub repository view:

**Overall Structure:**

The image presents a screenshot of a GitHub repository page.  It showcases the file structure, commit history, basic repository information, and some standard GitHub interface elements.

**Top Navigation Area:**

*   **Repository Name:** "project1_final" is displayed in the top left, indicating the name of the repository. It's marked as "Public."
*   **Engagement Buttons:** "Pin," "Unwatch 1", "Fork 0", and "Star 0" are present, showing the repository's current engagement metrics (number of watchers, forks, and stars).
*   **Branch Information:** The current branch is "master." There are "2 Branches" and "0 Tags."
*   **Search Bar:** A search field labeled "Go to file" is available for navigating within the repository.
*   **"Add file" Button:** A button is present for adding files to the repository.
*   **"<> Code" Button:** A green button labeled "Code," likely used to access options for downloading or cloning the repository.

**Repository Files/Folders List:**

This is the central area showing the directory structure:

*   **Branch Status:** Text indicates "This branch is 8 commits ahead of main".
*   **Folder/File Listing:**
    *   "swati-iitm" appears to be the account that made changes.
    *   "last_minut" indicates the commit message for the root.
    *   "7d08160 - 2 months ago" indicates the commit hash and time for the root.
    *   "9 Commits" indicates the number of commits for the root.
    *   "\_pycache\_\_" (folder): Last updated "2 months ago" with commit message "version_latest".
    *   "data" (folder): Last updated "2 months ago" with commit message "version_latest".
    *   "Dockerfile" (file): Last updated "2 months ago" with commit message "updated, relative path".
    *   "LICENSE" (file): Last updated "2 months ago" with commit message "Initial commit".
    *   "app.py" (file): Last updated "2 months ago" with commit message "last_minut".
    *   "datagen.py" (file): Last updated "2 months ago" with commit message "updated relative path".
    *   "evaluate.py" (file): Last updated "2 months ago" with commit message "version_latest".
    *   "llm_code.py" (file): Last updated "2 months ago" with commit message "last_minut".

**Sidebar (Right Side):**

*   **About Section:**
    *   "No description, website, or topics provided." indicating a missing repository description.
    *   "MIT license" is listed.
*   **Activity:**
    *   "0 stars"
    *   "1 watching"
    *   "0 forks"
*   **Releases:**  "No releases published," with a link to "Create a new release."
*   **Packages:** "No packages published," with a link to "Publish your first package."

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image captures a standard view of a GitHub repository. It's a relatively new project (few stars, forks) and lacks a description and published releases or packages. The commit messages suggest the repository is under active development, with updates including bug fixes and feature improvements.

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.

Respected Sir,

* Yes Sir, I said the same, `.env` was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
* when we download the repository it doesn’t have the `.env` file,
* for docker image to build we need to add `.env` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
* after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
* As you said Sir that you will use separate `AIPROXY_TOKEN`…you can put that in `.env` file and build the docker image
* after that Sir its optional to pass `AIPROXY_TOKEN` again while running the docker Image
* just the `.env` file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable

and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:

```
git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git

```

adding `.env` with AIPROXY token and replacing `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` with new ones according to test environment

```
docker build -t llm-agent .

```

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent

```

and in another terminal

```
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

Thank you  
Kind regards

Respected sir  
I understand it’s my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from 9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my diploma.  
Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please.

Thanks for relentless efforts @carlton @Jivraj

I tested the docker file in docker playground again.. Please find the screenshot of the docker build command and the log output of the docker build.. It went thru without issues..

Was the latest docker file used from git lab? Because as explained on March 30 i had to remove the hardcoded http/https proxies of my office environment,

Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the text and relevant features:

**Overall Context:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web browser window interacting with a "play-with-docker" environment, likely a platform for experimenting with Docker.

**Key Text and Features:**

*   **URL:**  `labs.play-with-docker.com/p/cvqlfo01209000cd7ic0#cvqlfo0l_cvqlfsol209000cd7icg` - This confirms it's a Docker experimentation environment and gives an identifier for the specific session/environment.
*   **Title:** `cvqlfoo1_cvqlfsol209000cd7icg` - This title provides an identifier for this specific Docker instance or node within the play-with-docker setup.
*   **IP Address:** `192.168.0.13` - This is the IP address assigned to the Docker instance.
*   **"OPEN PORT" button:** Suggests the ability to expose ports from the Docker container for external access.
*   **"Memory" and "CPU" Labels:** Indicate that resource usage information would be displayed in these sections.
*   **SSH Connection:**  `ssh ip172-18-0-93-cvqlfo01209000cd7ic0@direct.labs.play-` - This line provides the SSH command to connect to the Docker instance.  It's a full SSH command including the username and hostname. The copy icon to the right suggests a way to copy this command.
*   **"DELETE" and "EDITOR" Buttons:** Indicate options to delete the instance or edit configurations, respectively.
*   **Terminal Output:**
    *   `[node1] (local) root@192.168.0.13 ~` - This is the prompt from a terminal running inside the Docker container. It indicates that the user is `root` at the IP address `192.168.0.13`
    *   `$ docker build -t tdsproject1:latest . > tds-projlbuild.log` - This is a command being executed within the Docker container. It is building a Docker image tagged as "tdsproject1:latest". The output of the build process is being redirected to a file named "tds-projlbuild.log".

**Other details:**

*   The clock shows the time `1:44:22`.
*   Tabs in the browser include `want sir Attit...`, `sadhguru anything...`, `(42) Reciprocating si...`, `1272572-disha5.jpg...`, `disha%20patani%20...` and `BIGGEST Announce...`.

**In summary, the image shows a user interacting with a Docker instance in a "play-with-docker" environment. The user is in a terminal building a docker image, and the image also shows information about IP address and SSH connection information to the docker instance.**
 Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the details:

*   **Title:** Commits on Mar 30, 2025
*   **Commit Message:** Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies
*   **Author:** rsjay1976 authored last week
*   **Verification:** Verified
*   **Commit Hash:** a71e3a8

The image shows information about a code commit, including the date of the commit, the commit message (describing the change made), the author, and the commit's unique hash. It also indicates that the commit has been verified.

22f3002723:

> Was the latest docker file used from git lab

No, we are not allowing any changes to repo after deadline, this is consistent rule for every student. We pulled your github repo latest commit before 18th feb, I am getting following error.
Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Context:**

The image is a screenshot of a terminal window, likely running in a Linux environment. It shows the output of a Docker build process. The process has failed during the execution of a Dockerfile instruction.

**Terminal Window Content:**

1.  **Command Prompt:** The prompt `root@tds-course-temp-bq:/mnt/sdb/github_approach/github_repos/22f3002723/TDS-Project1-Jan25-622ed8adf432b6c539321e6519d62da09248a542#` indicates the current directory.  It shows the user is root and they are deep within nested directories.
2.  **Commands:** A series of `cd` (change directory) commands were executed, followed by a `docker build` command.

    *   `cd github_repos/`
    *   `cd 22f3002723/`
    *   `cd TDS-Project1-Jan25-622ed8adf432b6c539321e6519d62da09248a542/`
    *   `docker build -t 22f3002723:latest .` (This command attempts to build a Docker image, tagging it as `22f3002723:latest`.)

3.  **Docker Build Output:** The terminal output shows the progress of the Docker build. The `=>` symbols indicate steps in the build process:

    *   **Initial Setup:**  It loads the build definition from the Dockerfile, metadata for the base image (`docker.io/library/python:latest`), and the build context.
    *   **Layer Caching:**  The line `CACHED [1/7] FROM docker.io/library/python:latest` indicates that the base image layer was already available in the local Docker cache.
    *   **Running Commands:**
        *   `[2/7] RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates && apt-get clean && rm -rf` This step updates the package lists and installs `curl` and `ca-certificates`, common utilities.
        *   `[3/7] RUN curl -sSfL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`  This step downloads a script from astral.sh using `curl` and executes it with `sh`. This likely installs a utility named `uv`.

4.  **Error Message:** The build process fails at step `[4/7]` with the following:
    *   `=> ERROR [4/7] RUN uv --version`  (This means the command `uv --version` failed)
    *   `> [4/7] RUN uv --version:`
    *   `0.240 /bin/sh: 1: uv: not found` (This indicates that the `uv` executable was not found in the system's PATH.)

5.  **Dockerfile Snippet:** A portion of the Dockerfile is displayed, indicating the line that caused the error:

    *   `23 |`
    *   `24 |  # Verify uv installation`
    *   `25 >>> RUN uv --version` (This is the problematic line. The Dockerfile is trying to run `uv --version` to confirm the installation from the previous step.)
    *   `26 |`
    *   `27 |  # Set working directory inside the container`

6.  **Final Error Message:** A final error message confirms the build failure:

    *   `ERROR: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c uv --version" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127`

**Interpretation of the Error:**

The core problem is that the `uv` utility, which was intended to be installed by the `curl` command in the previous step, is not found when `uv --version` is executed. This means either:

*   The installation script failed without an obvious error.
*   The installation script installed `uv` in a location that is not in the system's PATH within the Docker container.
*   There's a problem with how `uv` is invoked.

**Other Details:**

*   **Operating System:** The prompt suggests a Linux-based system.
*   **Time:** The clock in the lower-right corner shows "02:37" and the date "09-04-2025".

In summary, the image captures a failed Docker build where the `uv` utility, intended to be installed by a script, cannot be found when the Dockerfile attempts to verify its installation.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image contains a single letter "S" in white, centered against a solid, muted blue-gray background. The letter "S" appears to be in a simple, rounded font. It's lowercase. The image is simple and minimalistic.

The image contains a single element: a yellow smiley face emoji.

**Features:**

*   **Shape:** It's a perfect circle.
*   **Color:** The primary color is a bright, cheerful yellow.
*   **Eyes:** The emoji has two oval-shaped eyes, filled with a dark brown or black color.
*   **Mouth:** There is a simple, curved line representing a smiling mouth. The mouth is dark.
*   **Expression:** The overall expression is positive, happy, and friendly.

Essentially, it's a classic, simple depiction of a smiling face.

> To test the functionality correctly, `npx` must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:

That destroys the purpose of containerization, your container should run anywhere anytime, all the dependencies must be preinstalled.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a woman in an outdoor setting, possibly a park or garden. The focus seems to be on her.

**Subject:**

*   **Person:** The main subject is a woman with dark hair. She is wearing a dark-colored jacket or coat. She appears to be adjusting something around her neck or chest, potentially closing her jacket. Her expression is difficult to discern clearly, but she seems to be looking down or concentrating on what she's doing.

**Setting & Background:**

*   **Outdoors:** The background suggests an outdoor environment.
*   **Vegetation:** There are trees and foliage visible, indicating it could be a park or garden. The colors are muted, possibly suggesting it's autumn or a cloudy day.
*   **Ground:** The ground is covered in grass or perhaps fallen leaves.

**Objects & Features:**

*   **Clothing:** The woman is wearing a dark-colored jacket or coat.
*   **Focus:** The focus is mainly on the woman and what she is doing with her jacket.

**Based on these details, you could ask and potentially answer the following questions:**

*   What is the woman wearing?
*   What is she doing with her hands?
*   What is the setting of the image?
*   What time of year might it be?

If you have more specific questions, feel free to ask!

Thanks @carlton @Jivraj  
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office proxy url’s set as http\_proxy and https\_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.

Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,

Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.

**Subject:** Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1  
@carlton @Jivraj  
Sir,  
Regarding the recent feedback on **Project 1** for **TDS**, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named **`dockerfile`** (not **`Dockerfile`**). Please verify the repository again with this in mind.

Additionally, my Docker image architecture is *linux/amd64* (64-bit **x86**). I have also filled out the **Architecture Information Collector** form as requested.

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**  
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1  
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1  
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 0

Contribute to 23f1001822/task\_agent\_api development by creating an account on GitHub.

**Docker repo submitted:** *sakshamumate/task\_agent\_api*

I kindly request a **reevaluation of my project marks** based on these clarifications.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you need any further information or clarification.

Best regards,

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image shows a GitHub repository page for a project named "task_agent_api." It's a screenshot of the main code directory within the repository.

**Key Elements and Text:**

*   **Repository Information:**
    *   Owner: 23f1001822
    *   Repository Name: task\_agent\_api
    *   Status: Public
*   **Navigation:**
    *   Code tab is selected
    *   Links to Issues, Pull Requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, Settings
*   **Branch/Tag Information:**
    *   Branch: main
    *   1 Branch, 0 Tags
*   **File List:**
    *   myenv
    *   \_\_pycache\_\_
    *   .env
    *   LICENSE
    *   README.md
    *   app.py
    *   datagen.py
    *   dockerfile (This is highlighted)
    *   evaluate.py
    *   requirements.txt
    *   tasksAy
*   **Commit Information:**
    *   Each file has a "last commit" message and a timestamp ("2 months ago")
    *   A "4 Commits" badge is visible
*   **About Section:**
    *   "No description, website, or topics provided."
    *   Links to Readme, MIT License, Activity, etc.
*   **Releases and Packages Section:**
    *   "No releases published"
    *   "No packages published"
*   **Contributors:**
    *   "Contributors(2)" is visible.

**Interpretation:**

The project appears to be in an early stage of development, with initial commits made around 2 months ago. The repository contains Python files (`app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`), a `requirements.txt` file (indicating Python dependencies), a `dockerfile` (for containerization), and standard repository files like `README.md` and `LICENSE`. The presence of `.env` and `myenv` suggests the use of environment variables.
The `dockerfile` is being highlighted, suggesting that the user has the mouse hovered over it.

**Overall impression:**
It is a screenshot of the main view of a github repo, showing the code directory.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image is a GitHub repository page overview. It's predominantly white, with a blue bar at the very bottom.

**Text:**

*   **Repository Name:** The most prominent text is the repository name, divided into two lines:
    *   `23f1001822/`
    *   `task_agent_api`
*   **Repository Statistics:** Below the repository name, there are stats:
    *   `2 Contributors`
    *   `0 Issues`
    *   `0 Stars`
    *   `0 Forks`

**Iconography:**

*   **Repository Icon:** A stylized, abstract icon is on the right side, near the top. It seems to be composed of square elements.
*   **GitHub Icon:** The official GitHub icon (the octocat) is visible at the bottom right.
*   **Statistics Icons:** Small icons accompany the statistics, representing contributors, issues, stars, and forks.

**Color Palette:**

*   White background
*   A shade of blue for the title and some of the elements
*   A muted color for the background behind the repo logo

I’ve got good news for you and 30 other students. Thanks to your diligent debugging effort that we were able to find this bug. For now the fix is that we will not evaluate you on a8 and catch the datagen exception so as to not cause cascading failures.

Thanks and kind regards.  
We will let you know the outcome of the evaluations soon.

any way out for my earlier query ?

@carlton  
Thank you for the reply .But it was working when i ran the initial evalaute.py .If you don’t mind could you tell what may have caused this to happen.

Hi Hilal,

You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post

Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science

> To replicate the test environment:
> Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.
> # /// script
> # dependencies = [
> # "requests",
> # ]
> # ///
> import requests
> import datetime as dt
> import zoneinfo
> import argparse
> import os
> import zipfile
> parser = argparse.…

That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.

The specific error itself means:  
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.

If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

Kind regards
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Appearance:**

*   It's a medium-resolution portrait photograph.
*   The background is a plain, soft yellow or beige color.
*   The subject is a man.

**Subject Details:**

*   **Gender:** Male
*   **Age:** He appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s.
*   **Ethnicity:** Judging from his features and skin tone, he appears to be of South Asian descent.
*   **Hair:** He has short, dark hair, neatly styled with a side part.
*   **Eyes:** He is wearing eyeglasses with a dark frame. The lenses are rectangular.
*   **Expression:** He has a warm, friendly smile.
*   **Clothing:** He is wearing a purple button-down shirt.
*   **Posture:** He is facing the camera directly.

**Other Relevant Features:**

*   The lighting is soft and even, suggesting a diffused light source.
*   The image is well-composed, with the subject centered in the frame.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific aspect!

sir for my project 1 i got a mail stating that the docker file isn’t public and that’s why prerequisite failed. but i checked it and it seemed absolutely perfect to me. Please look into this issue as my docker repo is public and absolutely as per the requirement. @carlton @Jivraj

Hi @22f3003083

Following was your submission, which is not a valid dockerrepo.  

image1829×251 22 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a data table or log viewer within a web-based application, likely related to software development or version control.  It shows a tabular display of data related to projects.  There is a search bar at the top of the table with a query in it, and then the results displayed in a table below.

**Top Section:**

*   **Navigation/Toolbar:** The top area features tabs labeled "Preview", "Code", and "Blame", suggesting that this interface is for viewing or managing code or project files.
*   **File Information:** Next to the tabs, it displays the information "1069 lines (1069 loc) · 127 KB", indicating the size and line count of the currently viewed file.
*   **Action Buttons:** On the far right, there are buttons for "Raw" data viewing, copying to clipboard, downloading, editing, and other options.

**Search Bar:**

*   A search bar is present with a magnifying glass icon indicating its purpose.
*   The search query entered is "22f3003083/v1"

**Data Table:**

*   **Header Row:** The table has the following column headers:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Email Address
    *   What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?
    *   What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?

*   **Data Row:** The table contains at least one data row:
    *   **Timestamp:** 2/16/2025 23:20:17
    *   **Email Address:** 22f3003083@ds.study.itm.ac.in
    *   **GitHub Repository Link:** https://github.com/22f3003083/TDS\_Project\_1
    *   **DockerHub Image Name:** 22f3003083/v1
*   The data row has the number "932" to the left, likely an identifier.

**Key Features and Text:**

*   The presence of the "GitHub repository" and "DockerHub image" columns suggests that the data table is tracking information about projects, their code repositories, and corresponding Docker images.
*   The email addresses seem to be associated with a domain "ds.study.itm.ac.in," indicating an academic or educational context.

In summary, this image displays information about a project named "TDS\_Project\_1" which is stored on GitHub and published on DockerHub. The table shows the timestamp, email address, GitHub link, and DockerHub image name associated with the project. The search term used was "22f3003083/v1" which matches the DockerHub image name.

@carlton @Jivraj  
As requested earlier, Could you please reevaluate my submission. The only change that had to be done post Feb 18 checkin was to remove my office proxies on Mar 30 from the docker file to make it work in all environments.. It would be great if this could be accomodated..

Hi Jayaram,

Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.

Kind regards

Thanks for the response @carlton .. just a small suggestion, to avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a dev/mock linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of everyone having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers.. Anyway thanks and appreciate all the help

image1737×291 23.2 KB

We are considering latest submission which have docker repo `maheshsingh01/tdsrepos`   
which is not accessible publically.  

image1866×949 92.7 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image shows a table or a grid-like display of data, likely from a database or spreadsheet application. There are columns with headers and rows of data entries. A search bar sits above the table.

**Text and Data Fields:**

*   **Search Bar:** At the top, there is a search bar with the text "23f1001236". The magnifying glass icon indicates its function.
*   **Column Headers:** The table contains the following column headers:
    *   "Timestamp"
    *   "Email Address"
    *   "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?"
    *   "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?"

*   **Data Rows:** The table contains three data rows, each with entries corresponding to the column headers:

    *   **Row 1 (203):**
        *   Timestamp: 2/15/2025 20:29:39
        *   Email Address: 23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
        *   GitHub Link: https://github.com/MaheshSingh01/tds\_proj.git
        *   DockerHub Image Name: maheshsingh01/tds-proj
    *   **Row 2 (758):**
        *   Timestamp: 2/16/2025 21:28:12
        *   Email Address: 23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
        *   GitHub Link: https://github.com/MaheshSingh01/tdsrepos.git
        *   DockerHub Image Name: maheshsingh01/tdsrepos
    *   **Row 3 (1012):**
        *   Timestamp: 2/16/2025 23:53:46
        *   Email Address: 23f1001236@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
        *   GitHub Link: https://github.com/MaheshSingh01/tdsrepos.git
        *   DockerHub Image Name: maheshsingh01/tdsrepos

**Objects and Features:**

*   **Table:** The main element is the table, with clearly defined columns and rows.
*   **Search Icon:** The magnifying glass icon next to the search bar.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image represents a dataset likely related to student submissions for a project. It tracks the timestamp of the submission, the student's email address, the link to their GitHub repository containing the project code, and the name of the DockerHub image they published. The search bar suggests the ability to filter the data based on a specific query. Based on the entered query "23f1001236" the application seems to show only those entries that match this query.
 Here's a detailed description of the image's content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of a web page displaying a 404 error message on Docker Hub.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Header:**
    *   Docker Hub logo (a stylized hand) in the top left corner.
    *   Address bar showing the URL: "https://hub.docker.com/r/maheshsingh01/tdsrepos/tags".
    *   Search bar with the text "Search Docker Hub".
    *   Navigation buttons: Sign in, Sign up
*   **Content Area:**
    *   Error message "404" in large, white font.
    *   Smaller text below: "Oops!" and "The page you have requested was not found."
    *   A cartoon illustration showing a person looking at a computer with a sad expression, reinforcing the error message. The illustration is set inside a blue circle.
*   **Path:**
    *   Below the header, showing "Explore / maheshsingh01 / tdsrepos".
*   **Other Icons and Elements:**
    *   Browser controls (back arrow, refresh).
    *   Standard browser icons (e.g., star, settings).

**Textual Information:**

*   "dockerhub"
*   "https://hub.docker.com/r/maheshsingh01/tdsrepos/tags"
*   "Search Docker Hub"
*   "404"
*   "Oops!"
*   "The page you have requested was not found"
*   "Explore"
*   "maheshsingh01"
*   "tdsrepos"
*   "Sign in"
*   "Sign up"
*   "Update"

**Interpretation:**

The image indicates that the specified URL (associated with Docker Hub, a user "maheshsingh01," and a repository "tdsrepos") could not be found. The "404" error is a standard HTTP status code indicating that the server is unable to locate the requested resource. The illustration and text convey that something is missing or inaccessible.

Hi @21f3003107

You need to look it up yourself, We have sent out evaluation log and docker log files, check those out.  
Evaluation script and other scripts that we have used are there in github repository over here.  
Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies - Courses / Tools in Data Science - IITM-DSA  
If there is some mistake from our end let us know about it.

To replicate test environment follow steps provided below.

@carlton Requested sir  
This is to request that in my evaluation a got 0 cause of the use of lowercase d instead of uppercase D but I have already submitted the docker file in my git hub repo also.  

WhatsApp Image 2025-04-11 at 23.34.06\_a49fd1e5912×727 79.5 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of a file directory listing within a repository, likely on a platform like GitHub or GitLab. The background is a dark theme.
*   On the right edge there are vertical navigation icons.

**File List:**

The main part of the image displays a list of files and their associated commit information. Here's what we can identify:

*   **Filename and Icon:** Each line represents a file and begins with a document icon and the filename (e.g., ".dockerignore", ".gitattributes", ".gitignore").
*   **Commit Message/Action:** To the right of the filename, there's a brief description of the action performed on the file (e.g., "added", "Initial commit").
*   **Time/Date:** Farther to the right, the time that action was completed is displayed. It is all reported as "2 months ago", except for a commit at the top listed as "eff178a - 2 months ago".
*   **Files in the Listing:**
    *   `.dockerignore`
    *   `.gitattributes`
    *   `.gitignore`
    *   `LICENSE`
    *   `README.md`
    *   `app.py`
    *   `datagen.py`
    *   `dockerfile`
    *   `evaluate.py`
    *   `requirements.txt`
    *   `tasksA.py`
    *   `tasksB.py`

**Top Row:**

*   The top row displays the user "wag28" and the action "added" as well as the SHA of that commit.

**Important Notes:**

*   The files with leading dots (`.dockerignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`) are typically configuration files that define rules or settings for the repository.
*   The presence of files like `requirements.txt` and several `.py` files (python) suggest that this repository is likely a software project, particularly related to Python programming.
*   The `dockerfile` indicates that the project is set up to be containerized using Docker.
*   `LICENSE` suggests the project's usage terms. `README.md` contains a description of the project.

In summary, this image shows the commit history of a GitHub (or similar platform) repository containing files associated with a Python-based, Docker-compatible software project.

@carlton sir, my project 1 marks have still not increased even though while during evaluation it shows 4/10 for the task 1. It was said that the docker image prerequisite will be removed and without that the evaluation would be done, but there is still no change in my marks. please look into it once, as my dashboard currently reflects 0 for project 1.

I looked at your evaluation logs and it says 1 score instead of 10.

Good evening!  
1000092114|690x198

I am writing to you to request you please relook into the evaluation.

The docker image which I share is working at my end. The size of the image is 6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasn’t aware of the infra level restrictions.

I request you to kindly consider my request and please re-evaluate the assignment as I have contributed a lot of effort into it.

Thanks,  
Garima

@carlton @Jivraj  
Sir,  
I am Saksham Umate and my project 1 was to be re-evaluation because of docker file not found in root ,but it was their so you had given me confirmation that it will re-evaluate after end term. I had already shared my docker file systems configuration at docker hub

So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it

Tell me if any information is needed about project from my side  
Thank you!

Best regards,  
Saksham

Here's a detailed description of the image:

*   **Content:** The image is a square with a bright orange background.
*   **Text:** A white, sans-serif letter "S" is centered within the square. The letter appears slightly blurred or soft-edged.
*   **Overall Impression:** The image is simple and minimalistic, focusing attention solely on the letter "S".
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Image:**

The image shows an email screenshot on a mobile device. The email is from "Carlton D'Silva" and addressed to a group with the user being a bcc recipient. The email is about a failed prerequisite for "P1" submissions.

**Email Content:**

*   **Sender:** Carlton D'Silva (sent on April 9th)
*   **Recipient:** To a group (bcc: me)
*   **Subject:** (Implied: P1 Submission Requirements/Feedback)
*   **Body:**
    *   The email begins with "Dear Learner,"
    *   It states that P1 failed because a Dockerfile was not found in the base of the github repo's root directory, but that this requirement is being relaxed.
    *   P1 submissions will be reviewed only after the end of the term.
    *   A script will be run to search for the Dockerfile in the github repo.
    *   No changes to the github repo will be considered after Feb 18th.
    *   Spelling deviations will not be accepted in the required files.
    *   All other prerequisites must still be met.
    *   The Docker image has to build without errors.
    *   The Docker container must become operational within 5 minutes of starting.
    *   Evaluations will be carried out according to the specified test environment.

**Device Elements:**

*   **Bottom Navigation Bar:** Shows icons for email inbox (with "99+" unread messages), a chat-like application (with "4" unread messages), and a camera icon.

**Key Highlights:**

*   The email focuses on Dockerfile requirements and project submission guidelines.
*   It emphasizes the end-term-only evaluation of P1 submissions.
*   Deadlines and file naming conventions are stressed.

In summary, the image is an email from an instructor/coordinator communicating revised submission criteria for a project, likely related to software development and Docker.

Evaluations are done for such cases where Dockerfile(with name of Dockerfile as `Dockerfile`) was present inside other folders than root folder of your github repo.

Hi @22f3000819

We had updated datagen.py(try block for task) which affected 30 students, but scores changed only for 4 students, for others it remained the same.

@carlton @Jivraj  
Respected Sir,

I hope you are doing well.  
This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term  
I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required `Dockerfile` (with an uppercase ‘D’).

While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.

I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.  
So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.  
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
S. Sharmile

Hi Everyone,

We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score.

Thanks & Kind regards

@carlton  
Hi Sir,  
I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of effort into completing **Project1**, but I accidentally named the **Dockerfile** as `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’).  
Could you please consider evaluating it with that name? I’d really appreciate it.  
Thank you!

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   **Text:** The image contains the letter "S" in white.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid orange color.
*   **Style:** The letter "S" appears to be somewhat blurred, giving it a soft or glowing effect. The font is simple and rounded.
*   **Composition:** The "S" is centered in the image.

**Possible Interpretations:**

*   It could be a logo or icon.
*   It could be a sample image for a font or a demonstration of text rendering.
*   It's a simple graphic design element.
