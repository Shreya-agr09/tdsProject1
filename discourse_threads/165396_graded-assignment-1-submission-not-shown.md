Hello,

I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a web page interface, possibly for an online learning platform or assessment system. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar (Red):** A red bar at the very top displays "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST," indicating a time and date when something concluded. A small icon, likely a settings or options button, is in the top right corner.

* **Discourse Link (Light Blue):** A light blue box below the red bar contains a speech bubble icon and the text "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse," suggesting a link to a forum or discussion board.

* **Login Information (White):** Below this, the text "You are logged in as 22ds1000103@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" confirms the user's login status, showing a seemingly university-related email address. A "Logout" button is provided.

* **Recent Saves (Light Green):** A light green box labeled "Recent saves" lists three saved instances:
    * Each entry shows a "Reload" button, a date and time stamp, and a score.  The dates show saves on January 26th and 27th, 2025.

The overall style is clean and simple, typical of educational or professional web applications. The colors used are muted and easy on the eyes.  The content suggests a system where users can complete assessments, save their work, and participate in online discussions.
 The image shows a graded assignment webpage. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Heading:** "Graded Assignment 1" is prominently displayed at the top.

* **Due Date:** A message indicates that the due date for the assignment (2025-01-26, 23:59 IST) has passed. It also clarifies that multiple submissions are allowed before the deadline.

* **Troubleshooting:** A section provides several reasons why a student might have difficulty accessing the assignment, including:
    * Ad blockers
    * Cookie blockers/trackers
    * Javascript disablement
    * Browser incompatibility (Chrome is recommended)
    * Browser extensions
    * Overly aggressive antivirus software

* **Student ID Requirement:**  The webpage strongly emphasizes the need to use a specific student ID (in the format shown in the example) to access the assignment, warning that submissions without the correct ID won't be considered.

* **Question 1:** A single question is presented:  "I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it."  with radio buttons for "Yes" and "No" answers.

* **Answer and Score:** The student selected "No," which is marked incorrect, with a score of 0.

* **Accepted Answers:** The bottom shows that only "Yes" is the accepted answer.

* **Point Value:** The question is worth 1 point.

The overall appearance suggests an online learning platform or assessment system.  The image clearly shows that the student failed to correctly answer the question related to accessing and attempting the assignment.

@Muthupalaniappan

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.

Kind regards

Dear Sir,  
I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

sir can you please allow us to submit it . like open the seek portal for a few mins . because we have worked hard to finished the assignment and all our hardwork will be in vain … please

That's a close-up headshot of a man. 


Here's a description:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian descent, with dark hair, brown eyes, and tan skin. He's wearing rectangular-framed glasses and a purple collared shirt. His expression is neutral to slightly pleasant. The image quality is somewhat low resolution, making details slightly blurry.

* **The Background:** The background is a plain, light yellowish-beige or off-white color, providing a simple, uncluttered setting that focuses attention on the man.

* **Overall:** The image is a typical passport-style or professional headshot, likely intended for identification or professional use. There's no text or other objects present besides the man.

Hello,  
I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9, so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

Respected Sir,  
I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal  
According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?  
Thanks

@23f2005471

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Kind regards

Respected Sir/Madam,

I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox  
I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment  
and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this

This image shows a screenshot of an online graded assignment. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Top Section:**

* **Title:** "Graded Assignment 1"
* **Instructions:** A paragraph explains potential reasons for difficulty accessing the assignment, such as ad blockers, cookie blockers, Javascript being disabled, incompatible browser extensions, and overly aggressive antivirus software.  It lists six specific troubleshooting steps.

**Middle Section:**

* **Important Note:**  A bold warning states that using the correct student ID (an example is given in the format `22f3xxxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) is mandatory for the submission to be considered valid.
* **Question 1:** A multiple-choice question asks if the student has seen and attempted the assignment via a provided link (the link itself is partially visible and is marked as `this link`).  There are options for "Yes" and "No".
* **Result:** The student answered "No", which is marked as incorrect. The score is displayed as 0 out of 1 point.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Accepted Answers:** Indicates that only "Yes" is the correct answer to question 1.


The overall context suggests an online learning environment where students have to access and complete graded assignments, and the system provides troubleshooting information and ensures proper student identification.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low-resolution; it's a bit blurry and pixelated, suggesting it might be a low-quality scan or a compressed digital image.

Dear @s.anand sir,  
For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??

I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.

I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.  
I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be an online quiz or assessment. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Question 1:** The main question asks if the user has seen and attempted Graded Assignment 1, which is accessible via a link (indicated as "this link" in purple).

* **Multiple Choice Answers:** Two radio buttons are present, offering "Yes" and "No" as possible answers.

* **Incorrect Answer Feedback:**  The text "No, the answer is incorrect." is displayed in red, indicating the user selected "No" as their answer.

* **Score:** The score is displayed as "Score: 0," further confirming the incorrect response.

* **Accepted Answers:** A section labeled "Accepted Answers:" reveals that "Yes" is the correct answer.

The overall presentation suggests a simple online quiz format with immediate feedback on the correctness of the answer.  The use of color (red for incorrect, green for accepted answers) enhances clarity.

The image shows a dark-themed web page, likely from an online learning platform or quizzing system. Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Header:**

*   **"Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"**: This indicates the quiz or assignment ended on that date and time (Indian Standard Time).

**Instructions/Guidelines:**

*   **"Browser may struggle..."**:  Advises users to disable security restrictions or use a different browser if they have loading issues.
*   **"Use anything..."**: Explicitly permits the use of any resources, including the internet, ChatGPT, and external help.  Libraries and frameworks are also allowed.
*   **"It's hackable..."**:  The quiz can be solved by analyzing and modifying the code; this is explicitly permitted.

**Guidance on Taking a Course ("TDS"):**

*   The page asks "Should you take TDS this term?"
*   Two bullet points provide criteria for predicting success in the "TDS" course:
    *   Completing the assignment in under 2 hours suggests a likely "OK" grade.
    *   Scoring above 8/10 suggests a potential "S" or "A" grade, with effort and luck involved.

**Help and Discussion:**

*   A button prompts users to ask questions or join a discussion on a platform called "Discourse".

**User Authentication:**

*   "You are logged in as 23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" shows the user's login details, suggesting an academic or institutional context (possibly the Indian Institute of Technology Madras).
*   A "Logout" button is visible.

**Recent Saves:**

*   A section titled "Recent saves" shows three entries, each indicating:
    *   "Reload" (a button presumably to restart the quiz from a saved state)
    *   The date and time of the save (1/26/2025, 11:59:45 PM).
    *   The score achieved (9.5).  This indicates a high score was achieved repeatedly.

**Overall Impression:**

The page displays a quiz or assignment that is designed to be flexible and open-ended, encouraging exploration and the use of diverse resources, even allowing code analysis as a legitimate approach to problem-solving. The high scores recorded in the recent saves might indicate the quiz's difficulty is moderate or that many students are effectively utilizing the permitted resources. The institutional email address and the explicit instructions suggest this is part of a formal educational program.

@Jivraj @carlton I had made my submission for GA1 on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am also logged in from my email on the evaluatio website and my score is saved, can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be an online assignment submission portal. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Section:** This area displays a history of three "Reload" attempts at the assignment. Each entry shows a timestamp (date and time) and the score achieved during that attempt (9, 8.5, and 8).  The timestamps are all from January 26th, 2025.

* **Middle Section:**  A text box shows the user's request. The user states they have completed the assignment, saved their score, but forgot to click "yes" on a confirmation step. They ask for the submission to be evaluated. Below this is a message explaining that a student ID is required to complete the graded assignment.

* **Bottom Section:** This section presents a multiple-choice question: "1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it."  There are two radio buttons: "Yes" and "No". The user initially selected "No," resulting in a score of 0 and the message "No, the answer is incorrect." Further down, under "Accepted Answers", "Yes" is shown as the correct response.

* **Other elements:**  The image includes buttons for image upload ("image"), percentage indicators (100%, 75%, 50%), a trash can icon (presumably for deleting something), and a link to the graded assignment (the link is partially obscured but the words "this link" are visible).


In essence, the image captures a user's plea for their assignment to be evaluated despite overlooking a final confirmation step.  The screenshot reveals their multiple submission attempts and the final incorrect answer to the confirmation question.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low-resolution; it's slightly pixelated and not exceptionally sharp.  This suggests it might be a smaller version of a larger image, or a scan of a printed photo.


There is no text visible in the image. The focus is entirely on the portrait of the individual.

The image shows a screenshot of a coding assessment or quiz interface. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** Displays "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST", "Score: 0", and buttons labeled "Check" and "Save". This indicates a timed assessment that has ended.

* **Recent Saves Section:** Shows three entries indicating previous saves of the work, each with a timestamp, score, and whether it was a "Loaded" or "Reload" action. This allows the user to revert to previous versions.

* **Questions Section:** This is the main part of the screenshot, listing 18 coding-related questions with their respective point values (marks). The questions cover various topics including:

    * Using specific software (VS Code, Google Sheets, Excel, DevTools, GitHub)
    * HTTP requests
    * Command-line operations (using `npx`)
    * Data manipulation (CSV, JSON)
    * File system operations (moving, renaming, comparing files)
    *  SQL queries

* **Overall:** The image suggests a coding assessment platform where users are tested on their practical skills in different areas of programming and software usage. The interface is clean and straightforward.

Hi Mandy,

Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released).

Kind regards

I have done my GA1 and scored 10/10 still it’s showing 0 on my dashboard.  

GA11519×799 75.2 KB
The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying a coding assignment or quiz. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** Shows a URL fragment ("exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-g61") indicating a web-based assessment platform.

* **Due Date and Score:** A green banner displays "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST Score: 10/10," indicating the deadline and a perfect score.  Buttons labeled "Check" and "Save" are present.

* **Code Editor:** A section containing SQL code: `FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';`. This query selects rows from a table named "tickets" where the "type" column, after removing leading/trailing spaces and converting to lowercase, equals 'gold'.  The word "Correct" appears below.

* **Instructions:** A description explains the task: "Get all rows where the Type is 'Gold'. Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as 'Gold'. Calculate the sales as Units."  A "Check" button is shown below the instructions.

* **Status Message:** At the bottom, it states "Submitted" confirming a successful submission.  A warning is displayed: "If you submit again, it will overwrite your previous submission and score."  A final message encourages regular saving: "Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated."

In essence, the image captures the successful completion of a SQL query assignment involving data cleaning and selection. The code efficiently handles variations in capitalization and extra spaces in the "type" column.

TDS GA11080×371 18.9 KB

  
Wrong GA1 score on my dashboard
Here's a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a web page, likely from an online learning platform such as a learning management system (LMS).  The top header shows "IIT Madras Jan 2025-TDS".  This suggests the platform is used by the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, likely for a course in the January 2025 term, indicated by "TDS" which could be a course code or abbreviation.

The left-hand side features a navigation bar with two main sections: "Modules" (with a document icon) and "Grades" (with a grading scale icon).

The main content area displays details about a graded assignment:

* **Module 1: Development Tools:** This indicates the assignment is part of the first module of a course on development tools.
* **Graded Assignment 1:** This is the title of the assignment.
* **Assessment (Due: 26 Jan 2025):** Shows the assignment's due date.
* **Submitted:** A status indicator showing that the assignment has been submitted.
* **Your Score: 100:** Displays the user's score on the assignment.  A "View Chart" link is provided next to the score.
* **Peer Average: 99%:** Shows the average score achieved by other students. A "View Chart" link is also available here.
* **Median Score: 100:** The median score obtained by the class.

In the top-right corner, there are three icons: one that likely represents a chat or message function, a bell (likely for notifications), and a user profile icon.  The overall design is clean and simple with a light gray and white color scheme.  The layout and features are consistent with the user interface of many modern online learning platforms.

Hello,

I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a web page or application interface, likely related to online learning or assessment.  Let's break down the different sections:

**Top Bar (Red):**

* **"Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST"**: This indicates the time and date the session or activity ended.  "IST" likely refers to India Standard Time.  There's a small, unidentifiable icon in the upper right corner of this bar.

**Second Section (Light Cyan):**

* **"Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse"**: This section suggests a link or button to a forum or discussion board called "Discourse" for asking questions.  A speech bubble icon precedes the text.

**Third Section (White):**

* **"You are logged in as 22ds1000103@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."**: This clearly shows the user is logged in using an email address that seems to belong to the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITC) judging by the `iitm.ac.in` domain.
* **"Logout"**: A button to log out of the session.

**Fourth Section (Light Green):**

* **"Recent saves"**: A header indicating recent saved work or progress.
* **Three entries**:  Each entry shows:
    * A "Reload" button.
    * The date and time the save occurred.
    * The score achieved (presumably in a quiz or assignment).  These scores are 9.5, 10, and 8.5.

**Overall:**

The interface is clean and straightforward, typical of educational or assessment platforms. The information suggests that a user has recently completed or saved work, possibly a quiz or assignment, and has the option to join a discussion board for further questions. The time and date indicate a past activity. The use of the IITM email address strongly suggests an academic context.
 The image shows a screenshot of an online graded assignment. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Heading:** "Graded Assignment 1"

* **Due Date:** Clearly states that the due date (2025-01-26, 23:59 IST) has passed.

* **Submission Policy:**  Indicates that multiple submissions are allowed before the deadline, but only the final one will be graded.

* **Troubleshooting:** Provides a list of common issues that might prevent students from accessing the assignment, including:
    * Ad blockers
    * Cookie settings
    * JavaScript requirements
    * Browser recommendations (Chrome)
    * Browser extensions
    * Anti-virus software

* **Student ID Requirement:** Emphasizes that students MUST use their specific Student ID (with an example format) to access the assignment; otherwise, their submission won't be evaluated.

* **Question:** A single multiple-choice question asks if the student has viewed and attempted the assignment using the provided link.

* **Answer and Feedback:** The student answered "No," which is incorrect.  The score is 0 out of 1 point.

* **Accepted Answer:**  Displays "Yes" as the correct answer.

The overall context suggests this is a post-submission screen showing the student's incorrect answer and feedback, highlighting the importance of following instructions and troubleshooting potential access problems. The use of a specific Student ID implies a secure online learning environment.

@Muthupalaniappan

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.

Kind regards

Dear Sir,  
I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

That's a close-up headshot of a person. 


Here's a description:

* **The Person:** The image shows a man with tan skin, dark hair, and dark-framed glasses. He has a pleasant, neutral expression. His hair is neatly styled. He's wearing a purple collared shirt. 

* **The Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low resolution; the details are a bit blurry, particularly around the edges. The background is a plain, light yellowish-tan color, which is fairly uniform.

* **No Text:** There's no visible text in the image.


The image appears to be a standard headshot, possibly for professional purposes like a profile picture for a website or social media.  The lack of detail and slightly blurry nature suggest it might be a smaller version of a larger original image.

Hello,  
I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9, so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

Respected Sir,  
I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal  
According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?  
Thanks

@23f2005471

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Kind regards

Respected Sir/Madam,

I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox  
I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment  
and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this

This image shows a graded assignment page with a single multiple-choice question. The question asks if the user has seen and attempted the graded assignment, which is linked in the text. The user has selected the "No" option, which is incorrect.  The correct answer is "Yes".  The page also provides troubleshooting tips for accessing the assignment, including disabling ad blockers, enabling cookies and JavaScript, and ensuring compatible browser settings and antivirus software.  The student's score is shown as 0 out of 1 point.

* **The Person:** The image shows a close-up of a man with dark hair, brown skin, and glasses with dark frames. He has a gentle expression and appears to be in his twenties or thirties. He's wearing a purple collared shirt.

* **The Background:** The background is a plain, light yellowish-beige color, which is unfocused and draws attention to the subject.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is somewhat low-resolution; the details are a little blurry, especially around the edges. This suggests it might be a smaller version of a larger image or a photo taken with a lower-quality camera.


There is no text in the image.  The focus is entirely on the individual.

Dear @s.anand sir,  
For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??

I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.

I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.  
I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission

* **Options:** Two radio buttons offer "Yes" and "No" as answer choices.

* **Response and Feedback:** The respondent chose "No." The system indicates this is incorrect ("No, the answer is incorrect.") and displays a score of 0.

* **Accepted Answer:** Below, the system reveals that the accepted answer was "Yes".

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed webpage, likely related to an online quiz or assignment. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Header:** A red banner at the top indicates the assignment "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST."  A small, possibly close button is visible in the upper right corner.

* **Instructions:** Below the header, numbered instructions (5, 6, and 7) are given.  They emphasize that students can use any resources, including the internet, AI tools like ChatGPT, and even hacking the code to get answers, indicating a lenient or experimental approach to the assignment.

* **Guidance:**  A section asks, "Should you take TDS this term?" followed by two bullet points advising students based on their completion time and score.

* **Discourse Link:** A teal button prompts students with "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse". This suggests a forum for asking questions and interacting with others taking the assignment.

* **Login Status:** The text "You are logged in as 23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" reveals the user's login information. A "Logout" button is provided.

* **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves" displays three entries, each showing a "Reload" button and the date/time of a save (1/26/2025, 11:59:45 PM) with a score of 9.5.  This suggests an auto-save feature within the assignment interface.


The overall style is clean and straightforward, with clear instructions and a dark background for easy readability.  The features suggest a technologically advanced and possibly challenging assignment, perhaps within a programming or computer science context.

@Jivraj @carlton I had made my submission for GA1 on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am also logged in from my email on the evaluatio website and my score is saved, can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation.

The image shows a screenshot of an online assignment submission portal.  Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

**Top Section:**  This section shows a history of three attempts at reloading an assignment, each showing the date, time, and resulting score:

* **Reload 1:** 1/26/2025, 12:25:43 PM, Score: 9
* **Reload 2:** 1/26/2025, 12:22:01 PM, Score: 8.5
* **Reload 3:** 1/26/2025, 11:46:22 AM, Score: 8

**Middle Section:** This section contains a user's plea and relevant assignment information:

* **User's Statement:** The user explains that they completed the assignment, saved their score, but forgot to click "yes" to confirm the submission. They ask for their submission to be evaluated.
* **Student ID Requirement:** A clear instruction is given that the user MUST use their student ID (in a specific format) for the graded assignment; otherwise, their score won't be considered.

**Bottom Section:** This section contains a multiple-choice question and the user's response:

* **Question:**  A question asks if the user has seen the graded assignment and attempted it.
* **Options:**  "Yes" and "No" are provided as options.
* **User's Answer:** The user initially selected "No," resulting in a score of 0.  The text "No, the answer is incorrect" is displayed.
* **Accepted Answers:**  This section shows that "Yes" is the correct answer.

**Other Features:**

* **Zoom Controls:**  Buttons for zooming image are present ("100%", "75%", "50%"). There's also a trash can icon, suggesting a delete function.

In summary, the image captures a situation where a student seemingly completed an assignment but failed to formally submit it due to oversight. They're seeking intervention to have their work evaluated despite the technical error. The screenshot underscores the importance of careful attention to detail in online submissions.

That's a close-up headshot of a man. 


Here's a description:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian descent, with dark hair, brown eyes, and tan skin. He's wearing rectangular, dark-framed glasses. His expression is pleasant and somewhat neutral; he has a slight smile. He's wearing a purple collared shirt. The image quality is somewhat low-resolution, making details a little blurry.

* **The Background:** The background is a plain, light yellowish-beige or tan color, which is unblemished and provides no contextual information.

* **Overall:** The image is a simple, straightforward headshot, likely for an identification purpose (like a profile picture for online accounts, a company directory, or a personal ID). There is no text or other objects present in the image apart from the man.

The image shows a screenshot of a coding assessment or quiz interface. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** Displays "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST", "Score: 0", and buttons labeled "Check" and "Save". This indicates the assessment has concluded.

* **Recent Saves Section:** A box shows three recent saves with timestamps and scores, suggesting the user has worked on the assessment previously.  Each save is marked as either "Loaded" or "Reload".

* **Questions Section:** This section lists eighteen questions with corresponding point values (marks). The questions cover a variety of topics related to software development and data handling:

    * Version control (VS Code)
    * HTTP requests
    * Package managers (npx)
    * Spreadsheet software (Google Sheets, Excel)
    * Browser developer tools
    * Date/time manipulation
    * File compression and extraction (ZIP)
    * JSON data handling
    * Multi-cursor editing
    * CSS
    * File encoding
    * Version control (GitHub)
    * File manipulation (replace, list attributes, move/rename, compare)
    * SQL queries

The overall appearance suggests an online platform designed for assessing coding skills or knowledge in various programming concepts.

Hi Mandy,

Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released).

Kind regards

The image shows a screenshot of a coding assignment or quiz on a dark-themed platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Bar:** Shows a URL fragment (`exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-g61`), indicating a web-based assignment platform.

* **Due Date and Score:** Displays "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST Score: 10/10", indicating a completed assignment with a perfect score.

* **Code Input Area:** Contains a SQL query:  `FROM tickets WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';`. This query selects rows from a table named 'tickets' where the 'type' column, after removing leading/trailing spaces and converting to lowercase, is equal to 'gold'.

* **Status Indication:** A "Correct" message is visible, indicating the code is accurate.

* **Instructions:** Below the code, instructions clarify the task: to find rows where the 'Type' is 'Gold', ignoring spaces and case, and to treat variations like 'GOLD' and 'gold' as equivalent.

* **Buttons:** "Check" and "Save" buttons are visible, suggesting a submission and save functionality.

* **Submission Status:** A "Submitted" message confirms that the code was submitted.

* **Warning:**  A message warns that resubmission overwrites the previous submission and score.

* **Recommendation:** "Save regularly" advises frequent saving to ensure work is preserved.


In essence, the image captures the successful completion of a SQL query assignment, focusing on data cleaning and case-insensitive matching within a database.

Wrong GA1 score on my dashboard
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen displaying an online learning platform or gradebook. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Top Bar:** The top bar displays "IIT Madras" (likely the institution), "Jan 2025 - TDS" (possibly the term or course code), and some icons (likely for notifications, communication, and user profile).

* **Left Sidebar:** A sidebar on the left contains two main sections labeled "Modules" and "Grades," each with an associated icon (a document icon for Modules and a gradebook icon for Grades).

* **Main Content Area:** The central part displays information about "Module 1: Development Tools". 

* **Assignment Information:** Underneath the module title, it shows:
    * "Graded Assignment 1"
    * "Assessment (Due: 26 Jan 2025)"
    * "Submitted" (indicating the assignment has been submitted)
    * "Your Score: 100" with a "View Chart" hyperlink.
    * "Peer Average: 99%" with a "View Chart" hyperlink.
    * "Median Score: 100"


The overall design is clean and uncluttered, typical of an educational management system interface.  The use of hyperlinks ("View Chart") suggests that more detailed performance data is available upon clicking those links.  The color scheme is primarily light gray and white, with blue accents for links and labels.

Thats not the dashboard.

Screenshot 2025-01-30 171404432×321 16.6 KB
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be an online course module or learning management system (LMS). 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Header:** A dark blue banner dominates the top half. The text "Tools in Data Science" is prominently displayed in a lighter, sans-serif font in uppercase letters. Below it, in a smaller font, reads "NEW COURSE". The background of the banner features a stylized pattern of dark blue circles forming a gradient effect.

* **Body:** Below the banner, a light gray section displays "Week 1 Assignment - 0.00". This suggests a course with assignments graded out of a numerical scale.

* **Overall Style:** The design is clean, modern, and professional. The color palette is limited to shades of dark and light blue and gray.


The image strongly suggests an online learning platform presenting a new course focused on tools used in data science.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a pale green rectangular box containing a list of recent saves.  The text "Recent saves" is prominently displayed at the top in a slightly darker green.  Below this heading, there are three entries, each consisting of:

* **A blue button:**  Labeled "Reload" in a lighter-colored font.
* **Date and time:**  In the format DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM:SS am/pm.  The dates are all in January 2025.
* **Score:**  A numerical score is given for each save.

The three entries detail three separate saves, with slightly varying times on the same day or consecutive days.  The background of the box is a solid, light green. The overall style is simple and clean, typical of a user interface element displaying saved game data or similar information.

Over this background, the text "Tools in Data Science" is prominently displayed in a lighter color, likely white or a very light beige. Below that, in a slightly smaller font, it says "REPEAT FULL COURSE".

* **Footer:** At the bottom, a smaller section displays "Week 1 Assignment - 72.50".  This suggests a graded assignment within the course.

The overall design is clean and professional, typical of online educational platforms. The color scheme and layout suggest a focus on data science.

Hi Yogesh,

There is no discrepancy, your last submission *before* the deadline was on 22nd Jan 8:14 pm. You scored 7.25, exactly as mentioned in your recent saves.

The higher score was on the 27th of Jan *after* the deadline.
