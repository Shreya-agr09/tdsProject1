    * Development Tools
    * Deployment Tools
    * Large Language Models
    * Data Sourcing
    * Data Preparation
    * Data Analysis
    * Data Visualization

**Right Side Panel (Main Content):**

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed webpage or application interface, likely a course website or learning management system (LMS).  The interface is divided into two main sections:

**Left Section (Navigation):** This section contains a vertical list of items, acting as a navigation menu.  The top displays "Tools in Data Science" as the title. Below are several collapsible sections (indicated by arrows) including:

* Tools in Data Science (expanded)
* Development Tools
* Deployment Tools
* Large Language Models
* Data Sourcing
* Data Preparation
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization

A search bar at the top left says "Type to search".

**Right Section (Content):** This section displays the main content of the page, which is divided into sections with titles and bullet points:

* **Teaching Assistants:** Provides contact information for teaching assistants, including names, email addresses, and a mention of a virtual TA powered by GPT instructions.
* **Their Job:** Briefly describes the role of the teaching assistants.
* **Course Links:** A list of relevant course links, including:
    * TDS Discourse (a forum)
    * IITM BS Degree Programme Student Handbook
    * Tools in Data Science Public Course Home Page
* **Jan 2025 Links:** A list of links specific to January 2025, containing:
    * Jan 2025 Grading Document
    * TDS: Course page - Jan 2025
    * TDS: Course calendar - Jan 2025
    * TDS: Announcement group - Jan 2025
    * TDS: Course material - Jupyter notebooks, datasets, etc.
    * TDS: TA Sessions - Jan 2025 - YouTube playlist

**Key Features:**

* **Dark Mode:** The overall theme is dark, with light-colored text.
* **Clear Structure:** The information is organized logically using headings, bullet points, and a sidebar for navigation.
* **Course-Specific Information:** The content is clearly related to a course on Tools in Data Science.

The image suggests that the user is interacting with a well-organized educational platform providing both course content and support from teaching assistants.  The prominence of the "Jan 2025" links suggests that this is a section dedicated to resources relevant to that specific period.
