Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image contains a single emoji. It's a yellow smiley face. The face has two small, round, brown eyes and a simple, curved black line representing a closed smile. The face appears to be smooth and rendered with a slight gradient effect, giving it a three-dimensional feel. The background is solid black, which makes the yellow emoji stand out prominently.

For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working
The image contains a problem statement related to file manipulation in a Linux environment.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Task Title:** "Move and rename files (0.5 marks)" - Indicates this is a question worth 0.5 marks.
2.  **Instructions:**
    *   Download a file named "q-move-rename-files.zip."
    *   Extract the contents of the ZIP file.
    *   Use the `mv` command to move all files from their original subfolders into a single empty folder.
    *   Rename all files, replacing each digit in the filename with the next digit.  The example given is "a19b.txt" becomes "a20b.txt".
3.  **Question:** "What does running `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash on that folder show?" - This is asking for the output or result of the given bash command executed on the folder containing the renamed files.

In essence, the problem asks you to manipulate files in a certain way and then predict the output of a specific sequence of bash commands.

Hi anant,

Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

Hi Anant,

21f2000370:

> image1296×158 7.29 KB

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image features the letter "A" in white. The letter is slightly blurry or out of focus.
*   The background is a solid turquoise color.

**Notable Features:**

*   **Text:** The primary element is the letter "A".
*   **Color:** The color palette is simple: white for the letter and turquoise for the background.
*   **Focus:** The soft focus gives the letter a slightly ethereal or glowing appearance.
 The image shows a programming task description. It's task number 16 and is worth 0.5 marks, titled "Move and rename files".

The task involves downloading a file named "q-move-rename-files.zip", extracting it, and then using the `mv` command to move all files under folders into an empty folder. After moving the files, the task requires renaming them by replacing each digit with the next (e.g., "a19b.txt" becomes "a20b.txt").

The final question asks what the following bash command will show when run on that folder: `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum`.

Hi Hisham,

Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

Here is a detailed description of the image's content:

The image shows a question related to file manipulation in a Linux environment, likely part of a coding assignment.

*   **Headline:** "Move and rename files (0.5 marks)" indicates the task's objective and its assigned weight.
*   **Instructions:** The text describes a series of steps:
    *   Download a file named "q-move-rename-files.zip" and extract its contents.
    *   Move all files from the subfolders into a single, empty folder using the 'mv' command.
    *   Rename all files in the folder. Each digit in the filename should be replaced by the next digit in the sequence (e.g., 1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0).
    *   An example is provided: "a19b.txt" becomes "a20b.txt".
*   **Question:** A question about the result of running a specific bash command: "grep . \* | LC\_ALL=C sort | sha256sum" in the folder after performing the previously described file manipulations. This command line is made of the following parts:
    *   `grep . \*`: Lists all the content of all the files in the current folder.
    *   `LC_ALL=C`: Forces the `sort` command to use ASCII sort order (as opposed to language-specific sort orders).
    *   `sort`: Sorts the output alphabetically, line by line.
    *   `sha256sum`: Calculates the SHA256 checksum for the sorted output.
In summary, the image presents a coding challenge involving file manipulation, requiring downloading and extracting files, moving them to a single folder, renaming them according to a specific rule, and then running a bash command sequence to produce a SHA256 checksum of the concatenated file contents in sorted order. The question asks what the output of this command will be after completing the previous steps.

Hi Anant,

21f2000370:

> image1296×158 7.29 KB

Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:** The image features a teal or turquoise background with a blurry, white letter "A" in the center. The "A" appears to be a sans-serif font. Due to the blur, it's hard to determine any finer details like specific font type or stroke weight.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:** The image appears to be a question from a technical assignment or test, likely related to command-line scripting (specifically bash).

**Key Textual Elements:**

*   **Title:** "Move and rename files (0.5 marks)" - This is the task's objective.
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Download a file: "q-move-rename-files.zip"
    *   Extract the downloaded file.
    *   Use the `mv` command to move files from subfolders into a single empty folder.
    *   Rename all files by replacing each digit in the filename with the subsequent digit (e.g., "a19b.txt" becomes "a20b.txt").
*   **Challenge Question:** "What does running `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash on that folder show?" - This is the core question, asking the user to predict the output of a bash command sequence.

**Command Sequence Breakdown:**

1.  `grep . *`:  This searches for any character (`.`) in all files (`*`) within the current directory. In essence, it lists the content of each file that contains at least one character.
2.  `LC_ALL=C sort`: This sorts the output from `grep` lexicographically (in standard ASCII order) using the `sort` command, ensuring consistent sorting regardless of the system's locale.
3.  `sha256sum`: This calculates the SHA256 checksum of the sorted output.  The checksum is a cryptographic hash that uniquely identifies the input data.

**In essence, the question is asking what unique checksum of the files' content (after being searched by grep and sorted) is generated using the provided command.**

In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?

Which HTML content we want to take?
The image shows a question related to CSS selectors and data-value attributes. The question asks to find all `<div>` elements with the class "foo" within a hidden element and calculate the sum of their data-value attributes. It also includes a text box labeled "Sum of data-value attributes:" presumably for the user to input the answer.

Hi Hisham,

Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

@s.anand please guide me through this question, my answer is showing incorrect
Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on elements relevant for question answering:

**Overall Context:**

*   It's a screenshot of a web browser displaying an online assignment or exercise, specifically related to CSS selectors.
*   The assignment is titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development."
*   The user has a score of 8.75/10 and can "Check" or "Save" their progress.
*   The due date is Sun, 26 Jan 2025, 11:59 pm IST.
*   The browser downloads menu is showing files.

**Main Content Area (CSS Selectors):**

*   **Documentation:** The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is mentioned as a resource for learning about CSS selectors.
*   **Types of Selectors:** The page lists and briefly describes the three main types of CSS selectors:
    *   Basic CSS selectors: (e.g., `div`, `.container`, `#header`, `*`)
    *   Attribute selectors: (e.g., `[type="text"]`)
    *   Combinators: (e.g., `div > p`, `div + p`, `div ~ p`)
*   **Interactive Tool:**  "CSS Diner" is recommended as a tool to practice CSS selector skills.
*   **Challenge Question:** The user is asked to find all `<div>` elements with a class of "foo" within a hidden element. They need to calculate the sum of the `data-value` attributes of those elements.
*   **Answer Input:** There's a field labeled "Sum of data-value attributes:" where the user has entered "482".
*   **Feedback:** The answer "482" is marked as "Incorrect. Try again."

**Key elements for answering questions:**

*   The specific CSS selector task (finding `<div>`s with class "foo" and summing their `data-value` attributes).
*   The incorrect answer provided (482).

The prompt to calculate the sum of data value attributes of elements with a div tag and the class foo is the main question being asked.

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.  
When I logged in today it says score is 0.  
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?  
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?  
If [seek] (Nptel Seekh) can access [TDS exam] (Technical Assessment) then why we need to submit from seek?

The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to  the submissions to get a score for the GA.

The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or  
on the Tools in Data Science introduction page.

Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.

As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score.

We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.  
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

**For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.**

Kind regards
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a button labeled "Save".

**Details:**

*   **Shape:** The button is rectangular with rounded corners.
*   **Color:** The button has a solid blue background.
*   **Text:** The word "Save" is written in white. It looks like there might be a light or glow effect around the letters.
*   **Border:** There is a thin white border around the entire button.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a green square emoji containing a white checkmark. The square has rounded corners and a slight glossy effect, giving it a three-dimensional appearance. The green color is a medium shade, not too bright nor too dark. The white checkmark is simple in design, lacking serifs or any ornate details. It appears to be centered within the square.

**Key features:**

*   **Color:** Green and White
*   **Shape:** Square with rounded corners, checkmark inside
*   **Gloss:** Slight glossy effect
*   **Symbolism:** Represents confirmation, agreement, or completion.

Thanks @carlton.  
I answered questions on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.  
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)

Hi @Nelson

Your answers on the exam site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).

Kind regards

It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute `data-value`. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute `data-value`.

I am stuck with the last question. SQLite question.  
It gives the error:

```
Error: Got [[121510.39]]...


```

Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image features a **yellow emoji** depicting a face deep in thought. This emoji is characterized by:

    *   **Facial Expression:** A furrowed brow, a slightly downturned mouth, and a thoughtful gaze suggest the emoji is pondering something or feeling contemplative. The eyes are looking slightly up and to the left, contributing to the sense of contemplation.
    *   **Hand Gesture:** The emoji has its hand up to its chin, with a finger lightly touching its chin. This is a classic pose associated with thinking or deliberation.
    *   **Color:** The emoji has a round shape and the color yellow.

**Overall Impression:**

*   The image conveys the idea of thoughtfulness, consideration, or puzzlement. It's a common way to visually express someone is thinking hard about something.

Neutral Minimal Photo Collage Mood Board Instagram Story1080×1920 119 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a coding challenge or assignment. It combines the problem description, the Python code used to solve it, and the output generated by the code. The user has submitted an answer, but it was marked as incorrect.

**Elements from Top to Bottom:**

1.  **Problem Description:**
    *   **Title:** "Count Wednesdays (0.5 marks)"
    *   **Question:** "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-09 to 2012-06-19?"
    *   **Initial Incorrect Answer:** 1349 is marked as "Incorrect. Try again."
    *   **Instruction:** "The dates are in the year-month-day format. Include both the start and end date in your count. You can do this using any for..." (sentence is cut off).

2.  **Python Code:**
    *   **Imports:** `from datetime import date, timedelta`
    *   **Define the date range:**
        *   `start_date = date(1986, 8, 9)`
        *   `end_date = date(2012, 6, 19)`
    *   **Find the first wednesday on or after the start_date**
        *   `current_date = start_date`
        *   `while current_date.weekday() != 2: # 2 corresponds to wednesday`
        *   `current_date += timedelta(days=1)`
    *   **Count wednesdays by jumping 7 days at a time**
        *   `wednesday_count = 0`
        *   `while current_date <= end_date:`
        *   `wednesday_count += 1`
        *   `current_date += timedelta(days=7)`
    *   **Print the Result**
        *   `print("Number of wednesdays:", wednesday_count)`

3.  **Output:**
    *   The path to the Python file: `C:/Users/royml/Appdata/local/program/python/python311/python.exe d:/testing/1.py`
    *   **Number of wednesdays**: 1349

4. **Automated Grading System Answer:**
    *   **Question:** How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-09 to 2012-06-19?
    *   **Answer:** There are 1349 Wednesdays in the date range from August 9, 1986, to June 19, 2012

**Key Observations:**

*   The code attempts to calculate the number of Wednesdays within the given date range.
*   The initial answer of 1349 is marked as incorrect.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these aspects!

Minimal Square Photo Collage Photography Instagram Post1080×1080 126 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on textual content and relevant features:

**Overall Structure:**

The image is a screenshot of what appears to be a computer screen. It's split roughly in half vertically. The left side shows a code editor, likely an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), displaying Python code. The right side shows a video playing, related to computer science concepts, specifically character encoding.

**Left Side (Code Editor):**

*   **Code Language:** Python. This is evident from the syntax and keywords used.
*   **File Processing:** The code is designed to read and process data from CSV and TXT files.
*   **Encoding Detection:** The code uses the `chardet` library to automatically detect the encoding of the files to handle potential encoding issues.
*   **File Reading:** It opens files in binary mode (`'rb'`) to detect the encoding and then in text mode with the detected encoding to read the contents.
*   **Error Handling:** The code includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors like `FileNotFoundError` and `UnicodeDecodeError`.
*   **Data Extraction:**  The code splits lines based on a delimiter (likely a comma or tab) and extracts the symbol and the corresponding value.
*   **Symbol Check:** Includes a check to determine if the symbol matches a criteria (using a robust check).
*   **Value Conversion:** Converts the extracted value to a numeric type and adds it to a running total.
*   **Total Sum Calculation:**  Calculates the sum of values associated with specific symbols.
*   **Input Prompts:** The code likely has input prompts for the user to enter the paths to the CSV and TXT files.
*   **Output:** The program prints the final calculated sum.
*   **Code Snippets:**
    *   `with open(csv_file_1_path, 'rb') as f:`: Opens the first CSV file in binary mode to detect encoding.
    *   `rawdata = f.read()`: Reads the data from the file.
    *   `encoding = chardet.detect(rawdata)['encoding']`: Detects the encoding using `chardet`.
    *   `with open(csv_file_1_path, 'r', encoding=encoding) as csv_file_1:`: Opens the file in text mode with the detected encoding.
    *   `all_content = csv_data_1 + csv_data_2 + txt_data`: Combines the content of the files.
    *   `total_sum = 0`: Initializes a total sum.
    *   `symbol = parts[0].strip()`: Removes leading/trailing spaces from the symbol.
    *   `print(f"The sum of all values associated with the specified symbols is: {total_sum}")`: Prints the final sum.
*   **Program Output:**
    *   `Enter the path to the first CSV file: content/data1.csv`
    *   `Enter the path to the second CSV file: content/data2.csv`
    *   `Enter the path to the TXT file: content/data3.txt`
    *   `The sum of all values associated with the specified symbols is: 31512.0`

**Right Side (Video):**

*   **Video Content:** The video title is "COMPUTER STUFF THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU". The subtitle indicates the topic is "Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM"
*   **Presenter:** A man is speaking in the video.
*   **Supplemental Information:** The description includes a list of downloadable files:
    *   `data1.csv` (CSV file encoded in CP-1252)
    *   `data2.csv` (CSV file encoded in UTF-16)
    *   `data3.txt` (tab separated file encoded in UTF-16)
*   **Problem Statement:** "Each file has 2 columns: symbol and value. Sum up all the values where the symbol matches."
*   **Question to Answer:** "What is the sum of all values associated with these symbols?"
*   **Answer:** `31512`

**Connections/Context:**

The video content directly relates to the code shown in the IDE. The Python code is likely designed to solve the problem presented in the video – reading CSV and TXT files with different encodings, extracting data based on symbols, and calculating a sum.  The provided CSV and TXT files listed in the video description are presumably the input data for the Python script.

Hi Shouvik,

Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.

Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

Try copy pasting exact symbols `— OR † OR €` Can you share code in code block, it’s difficult to read symbols that are present.

Also have a look at what `all_content` variable contains, see if there are some problem with content.

Hi Jivraj,

I have tried with a different browser, but still not working. Below is the screenshot for your reference.  

Screenshot 2025-01-13 2240571005×714 27.3 KB

Thanks
The image shows a web browser error message. At the top left, there is an icon that looks like a broken plug with two rounded, colored ends not connected. The main text reads "Your connection was interrupted." Below that, it states "A network change was detected." An error code "ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED" is displayed beneath the message. At the bottom, there's a blue button labeled "Refresh." The background is dark gray.

One unicode character is in both UPPERCASE and lowercase. Do a case sensitive search.

@Samra this is almost certainly due to a (typically corporate) firewall or antivirus. Please try with a personal laptop from a public / home network.

(I face this problem at office often. Once, our company’s firewall blocked our own company website )
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a yellow circle emoji with a neutral or slightly sad expression. It has:

*   **Color:** A solid, bright yellow color fills the round shape.
*   **Facial Features:**
    *   Two dark brown, round eyes, positioned relatively close together.
    *   A downturned mouth, conveying a slightly frowning or sad expression.
*   **Overall Impression:** The emoji is simple and conveys a feeling of disappointment, concern, or general sadness.

**This is regarding Question 11.**

I have extracted all the elements and added them manually. Tried all the options. Not even one appears to be correct . I evne tried ChatGPT which gave the answer as 411. Which of the following should be chosen?

```

        <div class="bar baz" data-value="17">
          <div class="baz foo" data-value="29"></div>

siva.bhaskaran:

> `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md`

Shouldn’t it be `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 --write README.md` or `npx prettier README.md` (Depending on whether to write or read)?

Apologies, I may not know full context of the question, as I haven’t attempted GA1 fully yet
Here is a detailed description of the content in the image:

The image shows the letter "S" in white, slightly blurred, against a blurred purple background. The letter is centered in the frame. There aren't any other distinct objects or features. The focus seems to be entirely on the letter "S" itself.

I had this same doubt, I tried by adding the “span” tag’s value too it showed correct for me. I’d suggest you to try that.

Oh, good catch, @23f2000237 and @siva.bhaskaran - I made a mistake in the evaluation script. It included the `span`.

I fixed it. Note: None of the earlier answers are affected, i.e. if you got it right earlier, it’ll stay right.

7. **It’s hackable**. It’s possible to get the answer to *some* questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That’s allowed.

What does exactly mean, if someone could elaborate without giving it away, please?

Hello Gentlemen Instructors,

In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,  
In one of the classes, you said that there is something - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you please let me know how to go about it ??  
Thanks and regards,

Screenshot 2025-01-18 1543211317×630 30.9 KB

In question 3 of GA-1 while checking the answer it’s showing incorrect answer.

216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175

This was the output which I got after the execution of the given code in the question.Kindly guide If I did some error or error in entering the value.
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

The image shows a screenshot of a PowerShell terminal window. The terminal is displaying output from several commands executed by the user "kaiff."

The first command is:
```
Get-FileHash -Path formatted.md -Algorithm SHA256
```
This command calculates the SHA256 hash of the file "formatted.md" and displays the algorithm (SHA256), the hash value (216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175), and the file path (C:\Users\kaiff\formatted.md).

The second command is:
```
npx -y prettier@3.4.2 "F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\README.md" > formatted.md
```
This command uses the `prettier` tool (version 3.4.2) to format the file "F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\README.md" and writes the formatted output to "formatted.md," effectively overwriting the existing content of "formatted.md".

The `Get-FileHash` command is executed again, and the results are the same as before, as `formatted.md` was overwritten and then the command was re-run.

The following command is also repeated:
```
npx -y prettier@3.4.2 "F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\README.md" > formatted.md
```

The last command is:
```
certutil -hashfile formatted.md SHA256
```
This command uses the `certutil` utility to calculate the SHA256 hash of the file "formatted.md". The output displays the calculated SHA256 hash value (216375d6f5a1daf9eb6350251e9f0a7395a0b2988d58ed6e57d9568e8b1ad175) and confirms that the command completed successfully.

In summary, the image shows the user formatting a file using `prettier`, overwriting the existing "formatted.md" file, and then calculating the SHA256 hash of the formatted file using both `Get-FileHash` and `certutil`. The hash value remains consistent across the two calculations.

how to calculate How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1981-08-30 to 2017-07-17?

The dates are in the year-month-day format. Include both the start and end date in your count. You can do this using any tool (e.g. Excel, Python, JavaScript, manually).

@23f2005067 @23f2003751 I added a “Recent saves” feature.

This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.

image368×152 5.35 KB

Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic.

Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks.
Here's a description of the image content, focusing on textual and relevant features:

**Overall Layout:**

The image displays a section titled "Recent saves," which appears to be a user interface element from a software application or game. The background color is a light pale green.

**Textual Content:**

*   **Title:** "Recent saves" in a larger, bolder font.
*   **List of Saves:**  There are three save entries listed.  Each entry includes the following information:
    *   **"Reload" Button:** Each entry starts with a button labeled "Reload" in a blue box.
    *   **Date and Time:** Each entry includes a date and time stamp formatted as "from DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM:SS am/pm".  The dates are "19/1/2025" (appearing twice) and "14/1/2025". The times are "8:17:25 pm", "8:01:54 pm", and "9:23:11 pm".
    *   **Score:** Each entry includes a score labeled "Score:". The scores are "1.25", "0.25", and "0".

**In summary:** The image shows a history of recent game saves, including the date and time of the save and a corresponding score for each save. There is also a "Reload" button for each save, which would presumably allow the user to load that particular game state.

Sir i might already clicked 3 save todays. So the previous clicks dates are of today. And the same 0 score is showing this.
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot from a mobile device displaying a quiz or assignment interface. The layout is organized with distinct sections.

**Top Section (Header):**

*   **Status Bar:** Shows mobile status information including time (7:15 PM), network speed (0.8 KB/s), and battery/signal icons.
*   **Due Date:** "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". This clearly indicates a deadline.
*   **Score:** A button or area labeled "Score" likely leads to the user's score or related information.

If you are on windows, you might not be able to use sha256sum.

Here are two disussions that might help you out.

@Rohitkumar7463 @23f2003845

If you are on Windows Powershell  
Then instead of `sha256sum` you can simply use `Get-FileHash`

Send the output of the `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md` to a text file eg. `output.txt` and then use `Get-FileHash` on powershell with the `output.txt` and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.  
You might be able to pipe the data directly to `Get-FileHash` but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Kind regards

@s.anand Sir

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.

I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.

Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?

If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.

@s.anand sir,

Question 15 is under the section for linux

I got the file which needs to be processed to answer the question

image583×167 4.09 KB

I can solve this now using pandas.

From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Structure:**

The image presents a tabular data format, resembling the output of a file listing command (like `ls -l` on Unix-like systems).  It displays information about files in a structured manner.

**Columns:**

The table has four distinct columns:

1.  **Length:** This column shows the size (in bytes, presumably) of each file.
2.  **Date:**  This column indicates the date the file was last modified. Dates are formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
3.  **Time:** This column displays the time the file was last modified.  Times are given in HH:MM format.
4.  **Name:** This column contains the names of the files, including their file extensions.

**Data Rows:**

The image shows data for four different files:

*   **file0.txt:** Length 4094, Date 2004-03-10, Time 07:49
*   **file1.txt:** Length 8410, Date 2007-02-11, Time 18:46
*   **file2.txt:** Length 8062, Date 2000-01-26, Time 13:40
*   **file3.txt:** Length 9748, Date 2010-09-27, Time 00:34

**Visual Style:**

The image has a minimalist, text-based aesthetic. The text is likely rendered in a monospaced font, giving each character and column equal width. This is typical for terminal outputs or plain text representations of data. The background is dark, with the text appearing in a light color, likely white or a light gray/green hue. Underlines are used for the column titles.

@23f2000573 You can solve it with any tool you’re comfortable with, including pandas.

But since you *already* know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like `awk` (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches.

Sir is it right of sha sum question
Here's a detailed description of the image's content, focusing on the text and other relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a slightly blurry photo of a computer screen displaying a PowerShell terminal.  The terminal shows a series of commands being executed and their outputs.  The background of the terminal is blue.

**Detailed Breakdown of Text and Commands:**

1.  **Top of Screen:**
    *   "Try the new cross-platform PowerShell"
    *   URL: "https://aka.ms/pscore6"
    *   This indicates the user is likely using PowerShell Core.

2.  **Failed `cd` Commands:**
    *   `PS C:\Users\HP> cd downloads`
    *   `PS C:\Users\HP\downloads> cd Downloads` (Note the capitalization of "Downloads")
    *   Error Message (in red): "Cannot find path 'C:\Users\HP\downloads\Downloads' because it does not exist."
    *   "At line:1 char:1"
    *   `- cd Downloads`
    *   `CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (C:\Users\HP\downloads\Downloads: String) [Set-Location]`
    *   `FullyQualifiedErrorId: PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SetLocationCommand`
    *   This shows the user attempted to change directories using the `cd` command (change directory). The second attempt failed because a directory named "Downloads" (with the capital "D") doesn't exist in the specified path.

3.  **`npx` Command:**
    *   `PS C:\Users\HP\downloads> npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md >output.txt`
    *   This command uses `npx` (Node Package Runner) to run a specific version of `prettier` (a code formatter).
    *   `@3.4.2` specifies the version of prettier to use.
    *   `README.md` is the input file to be formatted.
    *   `> output.txt` redirects the output of the `prettier` command to a file named `output.txt`.  This means the formatted content of `README.md` will be saved into `output.txt`.

4.  **`Get-FileHash` Command:**
    *   `PS C:\Users\HP\downloads> Get-FileHash .\output.txt`
    *   This command calculates the hash (a unique digital fingerprint) of the `output.txt` file.  The `.\` indicates the file is in the current directory.

5.  **Output of `Get-FileHash`:**
    *   `Algorithm Hash Path` (Headers)
    *   `SHA256 7EA1921D69EAA2FDA9F6B5143A291C894CDC59E6CF6DBAA9EC8FFD4449A8F7E5 C:\Users\HP\downloads\output.txt`
    *   This displays the SHA256 hash value of the `output.txt` file. SHA256 is the hashing algorithm used.
    *   The path to the file is also shown.

6.  **Repetition of `Get-FileHash` Output:**
    *   `PS C:\Users\HP\downloads>`
    *   `>> Algorithm Hash`
    *   `>> SHA256 7EA1921D69EAA2FDA9F6B5143A291C894CDC59E6CF6DBAA9EC8FFD4449A8F7E5`
    *   `>> Path`
    *   `>> C:\Users`
    *   This shows another attempt at calculating and displaying the file hash.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Case Sensitivity:** The error message highlights the case-sensitivity of file paths in the operating system (likely Windows).
*   **Code Formatting:** The user is using `prettier` to format a markdown file.
*   **Hashing:** The `Get-FileHash` command is used to verify the integrity of the output file.
* **Output redirection:** This is used to write the content of the standard output into a file.

@Rohitkumar7463 The hash code is exactly what you see under the column Hash,

7E…E5

Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt

A Hash is a *nearly* unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

**Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question**

quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143 bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time accordingly.  
I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST.

thanks

I am getting error in the uv question.  
I have got the output json but I cant understand what part do I need to submit in the answer section.
Here's a detailed description of the image's content, focusing on text and relevant features:

**Overall Structure:**

The image presents a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formatted data structure. JSON is a human-readable format used for data transmission, especially in web applications. The data appears to represent HTTP request headers and other information.

**Key Components and Textual Content:**

1.  **Top-Level Structure:**

    *   The entire content is enclosed within curly braces `{}` signifying a JSON object.
    *   The object contains key-value pairs. The keys are strings (e.g., "args", "headers", "origin", "url").

2.  **"args" Object:**

    *   The "args" key maps to another JSON object `{}`.
    *   Inside this object, there's a key "email" whose value is the email address: `"241001769@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"`

3.  **"headers" Object:**

    *   The "headers" key contains an object of HTTP request headers. HTTP headers provide additional information about a client request or a server response.
    *   Notable headers and their values:
        *   `"Accept"`: Specifies the content types the client is willing to accept (e.g., "text/html", "application/xhtml+xml", images, etc.).  There's a quality factor (`q`) associated with each content type, indicating preference.
        *   `"Accept-Encoding"`:  Lists the encoding algorithms the client supports for compressing data (e.g., "gzip", "deflate", "br", "zstd").
        *   `"Accept-Language"`:  Indicates the preferred languages for the response (e.g., "en-US", "en" (English), "en-IN" (English - India)).  Quality factors (`q`) are used for prioritization.
        *   `"Dnt"`:  "1" - Likely represents "Do Not Track," a privacy preference.
        *   `"Host"`: `"httpbin.org"` - Specifies the domain name of the server being requested.
        *   `"Priority"`: "u=0, i" - Indicates request priority.
        *   `"Sec-Ch-Ua"`: Contains information about the user agent's brand and version using the Client Hints API. It indicates the browser versions being used. Specifically, it mentions "Not A(Brand", Chromium, and Microsoft Edge, with version "132".
        *   `"Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile"`: "?0" - Suggests the user agent is not a mobile device.
        *   `"Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform"`: "\"Windows\"" - Indicates the platform is Windows.
        *   `"Sec-Fetch-Dest"`: `"document"` - Specifies the intended destination of the fetch request is a document.
        *   `"Sec-Fetch-Mode"`: `"navigate"` - Indicates the navigation mode of the fetch.
        *   `"Sec-Fetch-Site"`: `"none"` - Suggests the request is not a cross-site request.
        *   `"Sec-Fetch-User"`: `"?1"` - Likely indicates that the request was initiated by a user gesture.
        *   `"Upgrade-Insecure-Requests"`: `"1"` - Signals the client's preference to upgrade insecure (HTTP) requests to secure (HTTPS) requests.
        *   `"User-Agent"`: A string identifying the client's browser and operating system.  In this case, it indicates Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64), AppleWebKit/537.36, KHTML, like Gecko, Chrome/132.0.0.0, Safari/537.36, and Edge/132.0.0.0. This reveals that the user is using Microsoft Edge (or a Chromium-based browser).
        *   `"X-Amzn-Trace-Id"`: `"Root=1-67903bee-5b25fdd838b5abb00263808c"` - Appears to be an Amazon-specific trace ID, possibly used for debugging.

4.  **"origin" Key:**

    *   `"origin"`: `"45.118.156.154"` -  The IP address from which the request originated.

5.  **"url" Key:**

    *   `"url"`: `"https://httpbin.org/get?email=241001769%40ds.study.iitm.ac.in"` - The URL that was requested, including the email address as a query parameter. `%40` is the URL-encoded form of the `@` symbol.

**In summary, the image contains a JSON object showing details of an HTTP request made by a browser (likely Microsoft Edge) running on Windows. The request was sent to `httpbin.org` and included an email address as a parameter.**

Sir I’m facing issue in this question even though i have done every thing as it mentioned. Can I get hint of the mistake for my code snippet.  
My code: -

```
mkdir all_files
find parent/ -type f -exec mv {} all_files/ \;
for file in all_files/*; do
    new_name=$(echo "$file" | sed 's/[0-9]/\n&\n/g' | awk '
    { 
        if ($0 ~ /^[0-9]$/) print ($0 == "9") ? 0 : $0+1; 
        else print $0 
    }' | tr -d "\n")
    mv "$file" "$new_name"
done

```
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an online assignment or quiz question. It involves file manipulation tasks in a command-line environment (presumably Bash).

**Textual Elements:**

*   **"16 Move and rename files (0.5 marks)"**: Indicates the question's title, the subject matter, and its associated marks.
*   **"Download q-move-rename-files.zip and extract it."**: Instructions to download and extract a zip file containing files to be manipulated.
*   **"Use `mv` to move all files under folders into an empty folder."**: Instructions to move files from subfolders into a single, empty folder.
*   **"Then rename all files replacing each digit with the next. 1 becomes 2, 9 becomes 0, `a1b9c.txt` becomes `a2b0c.txt`."**: Instructions to rename the files according to a specific rule (incrementing digits).
*   **"What does running `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash on that folder show?"**: The core question, asking for the output of a series of commands executed in the target folder. The commands are:
    *   `grep . *`:  Finds all lines containing at least one character. This basically lists the contents of all text files.
    *   `LC_ALL=C sort`: Sorts the output of `grep` using the default locale to ensure consistent sorting across different systems.
    *   `sha256sum`: Calculates the SHA256 checksum for each sorted line, generating a unique hash for each.
*   **"f1056c0b734ac835d17e8129fe9dc9a85ebcca45a82de42b13d18b7816808b7d \*"**: The user's incorrect answer, presumably a SHA256 hash.
*   **"Incorrect. Try again."**: Feedback indicating the answer was wrong.

**Objects/Visual Elements:**

*   The text is in a dark theme, suggesting it's a screenshot from a coding or learning platform with a dark mode.
*   The ".zip" text is hyperlinked, indicating it's an interactive element for downloading the file.
*   An error icon (a red circle with an exclamation mark) next to the input box shows that the provided answer was incorrect.

**Interpretation:**

The question tests the user's ability to:

1.  Download and extract files.
2.  Use the `mv` command to move files.
3.  Rename files based on a digit-shifting rule.
4.  Understand and execute Bash commands: `grep`, `sort`, and `sha256sum`.
5.  Determine the output of the given command pipeline on the modified files.

Good Evening, I have a doubt regarding the SQL Question I have attached my query. Please clarify me where I got wrong. I tried changing the gold string to lower and checking it. Even, that didn’t work.  

Screenshot 2025-01-22 2317181599×362 19.1 KB

  
Thank You.
Here is a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a coding environment (likely a SQL interface) where the user is tasked with writing a SQL query to calculate the total sales of "Gold" tickets. The user has provided a query, which returned an error. The image also includes the prompt and hints on how to write the correct query.

**Text Components:**

1.  **Prompt/Question:**
    *   "What is the total sales of all the items in the "Gold" ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it."

2.  **SQL Query:**
    *   "SELECT SUM(Units\*Price) FROM tickets WHERE TYPE == 'Gold';"

3.  **Error Message:**
    *   "Error: Got \[\[42810.5]].." (This suggests the query was parsed but didn't produce the desired result)

4.  **Hints/Instructions:**
    *   "Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units \* Price, and sum them up."

**Visual Components:**

*   The code and error messages are displayed in a text editor-style interface, with a dark background.
*   A red exclamation mark indicates an error in the query.
*   The font style and colors indicate a coding environment.

**Interpretation:**

The user's query attempts to calculate the total sales by multiplying "Units" and "Price" and summing the result.  However, it only considers entries where the "TYPE" is exactly "Gold".
The error message suggests that a calculation (Units\*Price) was made, and the system returned a specific value, likely indicating the user failed to properly handle the case-insensitive nature of the "Gold" Type and all misspellings of "Gold".

**In Summary:**

The image depicts a SQL coding exercise where the user's initial attempt to calculate total "Gold" ticket sales failed.  The prompt and provided hints guide the user towards a more robust query that accounts for case-insensitive matching and potential misspellings of the "Gold" ticket type.

I have another doubt regarding the CSS Selector question. I know how to select elements using CSS Selector but i don’t know how to get the sum using CSS Selectors as it cannot perform arithmetic operations. And also, I didn’t understand the question completely about the ‘hidden element’. Please clarify it. Thank you so much.

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Main Content:**

The image shows a question or task related to CSS selectors and data attributes. The user is being asked to:

1.  Find all `<div>` elements that have the class "foo" within a hidden HTML element (not visible in this image snippet).
2.  Sum the values of their `data-value` attributes.
3.  Provide the sum in the input box.

**Text:**

*   "Let's make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all `<div>`s having a `foo` class in the hidden element below. What's the sum of their `data-value` attributes?"
*   "Sum of data-value attributes:"
*   "Incorrect. Try again." (indicating the previous attempt was wrong)

**Visual Elements:**

*   An input box where the user types in the calculated sum. The box is highlighted in red, likely indicating an error.
*   A small information icon to the right of the input box.
*   The background is dark, which is typical for coding environment interfaces.

**Overall Context:**

This image captures a moment in a coding exercise or tutorial, where the user is attempting to apply CSS selectors and retrieve data from HTML elements. The "Incorrect. Try again." message suggests the user needs to re-evaluate their approach.

It can be GOLD,gold, or even GoLD.

" Get all rows where the Type is “Gold”. Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as “Gold”. Calculate the sales as Units \* Price, and sum them up. "

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Image Overview:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a programming environment or a system's command-line interface (likely PowerShell on Windows), along with a section of a webpage containing a question and an answer field.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Top Section (Command Line/PowerShell):**
    *   **Text:** The upper portion of the image shows what looks like the output of a PowerShell script or commands.
    *   There are multiple lines, starting with dates in the format "2019-11-06," followed by timestamps (e.g., "09:57"), file sizes (numeric values), and file names with the extension ".txt" (e.g., "FIL0301.txt").
    *   A "count" value is listed as 91.
    *   There are PowerShell commands:
        *   `.\list-files-attributes.ps1 | Get-ChildItem -Path . | Where-Object { $_.length -ge 1235 } | Measure-Object -Property length`
    *   This command seems to be listing files, filtering them by size (greater than or equal to 1235 bytes), and then calculating the total length of the selected files.

2. **Bottom Section (Webpage Fragment):**
    *   **Header:** "List files and attributes (0.75 marks)"
    *   **Instructions:** "Download `list_files_attributes.zip` and extract it. Use it with options to list all files in the folder along with their date and file size."
    *   **Question:** "What's the total size of all files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 am IST?"
    *   **Answer Field:** An answer field showing "507162" marked as "Incorrect. Try again".
    *   **Note:** "Don't copy from inside the ZIP file or use Windows Explorer to unzip. That destroys the timestamps. Extract using unzip. P.Zip or similar utilities and check the timestamps."

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image depicts a task involving a PowerShell script to analyze files. The goal is to determine the total size of files that meet specific criteria: a minimum size and a modification date on or after a certain time. The user has provided an answer (507162) for the total size calculation, but it has been marked as incorrect. The webpage fragment provides context and a caution about maintaining timestamps when extracting the files.

Hi Arnav,

I tried your script on your dataset.  
Problem might be you are not executing `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in correct directory, you would need to execute it from `all_files` directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.

Time of modification of each of these files is 14 Jan 2025 which might be the day you unzipped them. Depending upon what software you use it might change modification date while unzipping. use unzip command line tool or winrar extractor, these are 2 tools we have tested.

kind regards
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image features a single, uppercase letter "L" in white. It is centrally placed on a light blue square background. The letter has a soft, blurred or glowing effect, which makes it appear slightly out of focus. The illumination and shadow suggest a 3D effect, with the light seemingly coming from the top left.

**Details:**

*   **Letter:** The letter "L" is simple and appears to be sans-serif.
*   **Color:** The color scheme is simple, with a white letter on a light blue background.
*   **Style:** The blurred, slightly glowing effect and the lighting give the letter a smooth, modern, and possibly digital appearance.

**Interpretation:**

The image is likely a graphic design element or a stylized representation of the letter "L". It could be used as an icon, a logo component, or simply as an aesthetic image.
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Main Content:**

*   **Screenshot of a Command Prompt or PowerShell Window:** The upper portion of the image shows a dark window with white text, suggesting a command-line interface. It's running commands to list files and their attributes.
*   **Script Output:** The command output displays a list of files, seemingly from a directory. Attributes like file size and modification date are likely included.
*   **Challenge/Question:** Below the command prompt is a question or task related to the file listing. The user is asked to calculate the total size of files meeting specific criteria (size and modification date).
*   **Incorrect Answer Box:** A red box indicates that the user has submitted an answer (507162) which was deemed incorrect.
*   **Instructions:** There is a warning about not using Windows Explorer to unzip files, as it may alter timestamps. Alternative methods like uncia, 7-Zip, or similar utilities are recommended for preserving timestamps during extraction.

**Textual Information (from the Command Prompt):**

*   "Dir" and "Filename" (likely used to list file names)
*   "Where-Object" and "_Length" and "_LastWriteTime" (used to filter by file size and modification date)
*   Specific dates and times are used in the query, such as "11/06/2019 14:48:48"

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a coding challenge or assignment where the user needs to use command-line tools to extract information about files based on specified criteria (file size and modification time) and then perform a calculation. The user made an attempt but submitted an incorrect answer, indicating a potential error in their script or calculation. The instructions highlight the importance of using specific tools to preserve the integrity of file timestamps.

Hi Saravanan,

I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name `Bob`, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.

We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.

kind regards

In the question 10 what should be the correct format for jason data as I edited the data according to given conditions but in Hash I am facing problem again and again

Also, in Q11 What is meaning of element below given in the question " Let’s make sure you know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all `<div>` s having a `foo` class in the hidden element below. What’s the sum of their `data-value` attributes?"
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to show an interface where a user is attempting to input a "JSON Hash."  The input has likely failed, as indicated by the error message at the bottom.

**Detailed Content:**

1.  **Title:** "JSON Hash" is clearly displayed at the top.

2.  **Input Area:** The main portion of the image contains a long string of text, presumably what the user entered as the JSON hash.  It's a dense sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, and some punctuation. This input is separated into multiple lines.

3.  **Button:** A green button labeled "Hash" suggests that clicking this button would initiate the hash calculation process.

4.  **Error Message:** A red banner at the bottom displays the error message: "Error: Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)." This strongly suggests that the entered text is not valid JSON.  The error location (position 1, line 1 column 2) indicates a syntax error very early in the input.

**Key Elements and Implications:**

*   **JSON Failure:** The primary issue is the invalid JSON format.  JSON requires a specific structure of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces `{}` or square brackets `[]`. The entered string lacks this structure, causing the parsing error.
*   **Potential for Improvement:** The user needs to format their input correctly as a JSON object or array to resolve the error.

what sort of response am i supposed to put ?? the response i am getting ,it says incorrect, basically after doing code -s ,i get like info about the version of vs code and info about cpu gpu etc…
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a tutorial or interactive learning platform about AI-powered code editors. It instructs the user to run a command in their terminal and then input the output into a provided text box.

**Text elements:**
*   **Title:** "AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor"
*   **Note:** "AI Editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster."
*   "These are built on top of VS Code. These are now a standard tool in every developer's toolkit. Please use them."
*   "Install and run Visual Studio Code. In your Terminal (or Command Prompt), type `code -s` and press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below."
*   **Question:** "What is the output of `code -s`?"
*   "Incorrect. Try again." (This is shown below a text entry box.)

**Visual elements:**
*   There's a text entry box where the user is expected to input the output of the `code -s` command. It is currently empty and is bordered by a red line, meaning that the user entered the wrong output.
*   There is a red information symbol in the bottom-right of the text entry box.

**Key takeaway:** The user is being asked to execute the command `code -s` in their terminal (after installing VS Code) and then paste the resulting output into the provided text box. They have made an attempt, but the platform has indicated that the provided output is "Incorrect."

The answer is wrong but I have done every step correctly. Help
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Content:**

The image appears to be a screenshot from a programming/coding task or tutorial. It presents instructions to download a zip file, perform certain file manipulations, and then asks for the output of a specific shell command. The attempted answer is marked as "Incorrect. Try again."

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **Instructions:**
    *   **Download:** "q-replace-across-files.zip"
    *   **Unzip:** Extract the downloaded file into a new folder.
    *   **Replace:** In all files within the unzipped folder, replace all occurrences of "IITM" (regardless of case) with "IIT Madras".
    *   **Note:** Important - leave everything else as is. Do not modify the line endings.

2.  **Question:**
    *   "What does running `cat * | sha256sum` in that folder show in bash?"
    *   This question asks for the combined SHA256 hash of all files in the folder after the replacements have been performed.

3.  **Answer Attempt:**
    *   "63144b28ad1d2bd5b9b4b0855cab6a4a4fa8d57ed2ed826b4f5b36d12ae97347"
    *   This is the SHA256 hash that was input as the answer.

4.  **Feedback:**
    *   "Incorrect. Try again."
    *   Indicates that the provided SHA256 hash is not the correct output for the given task.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The task requires precise execution of the instructions, including the replacement of "IITM" with "IIT Madras" while preserving the line endings.
*   The question is about calculating the SHA256 hash of the concatenated content of all the processed files in the folder.
*   The incorrect answer suggests that there was either an error in the replacement process, a mistake in running the command, or potentially a hidden file that was altered unintentionally.

I tried this. For me still the answer is incorrect.

image1677×358 22.2 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

The image is a screenshot of a PowerShell terminal window. It shows a series of commands being executed and their respective outputs.

**Commands and Outputs:**

1.  `cd downloads`: This command changes the current directory to the "downloads" folder within the user's directory.

2.  `certutil -hashfile C:\Users\sarva\downloads\README.md SHA256`: This command uses the `certutil` utility to calculate the SHA256 hash of the file `README.md` located in the downloads directory. The output displays the calculated SHA256 hash: `eef23369e30d7bd99173ef4988c65a59b80bf56f60da4c9ab95c1903be312317`. It also confirms that the command completed successfully.

3.  `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt`: This command utilizes `npx` to run the `prettier` tool, version 3.4.2, to format the `README.md` file and redirect the output to a new file named `output.txt`. The `-y` flag likely confirms any prompts or questions that `npx` or `prettier` might raise.

4.  `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 output.txt`: This command utilizes the `Get-FileHash` PowerShell cmdlet to calculate the SHA256 hash of the `output.txt` file. The output displays the algorithm used (SHA256), the calculated hash value (`CECFD0A2DC971DE14A28CABF98ED854A9E6C7A94BD788AB0D10F5D991A4FA054`), and the file path.

**Layout and Structure:**

The commands and their outputs are displayed sequentially, typical of a terminal interaction. The PowerShell prompt (PS C:\\Users\\sarva\\downloads>) indicates the current directory. The hash values are presented as hexadecimal strings. The information from `Get-FileHash` is structured into a table-like format with columns for Algorithm, Hash, and Path.

**Overall Context:**

The image captures a workflow involving calculating the SHA256 hash of a file, formatting it using `prettier`, saving the formatted output to a new file, and then calculating the SHA256 hash of the newly created file. The comparison of the SHA256 hash of the README.md file (before formatting) and output.txt (after formatting) shows that the file's contents have been modified.

Finally. Got the correct one in bit dash.
Here's a description of the image content, focusing on text and relevant features:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of a terminal window, likely from a Unix-like environment (like macOS or Linux). The background is black, and the text is in various colors, typical of terminal output. It shows a command being executed and the resulting output.

**Detailed Elements:**

1.  **Terminal Prompt:**
    *   `sarva@SURIYA`: This is the username and hostname of the system. "sarva" is the username, and "SURIYA" is the hostname.  The text is green.
    *   `MINGW64`: This indicates that the terminal is running in a "MINGW64" environment, which is likely associated with a Windows subsystem for Linux or a similar environment.  The text is purple.
    *   `~/downloads`: This shows the current working directory, which is the "downloads" directory within the user's home directory (~). This is displayed in yellow.

2.  **Command and Output:**
    *   `$ npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum`: This is the command being executed.
        *   `npx`: This is a command that allows you to execute Node.js packages without installing them globally.
        *   `-y`: This is likely an option for `npx` to automatically confirm any prompts or installations.
        *   `prettier@3.4.2`: This specifies the "prettier" package (a code formatter) and a specific version (3.4.2).
        *   `README.md`: This specifies a file named "README.md" as input to the "prettier" command.
        *   `|`: This is the pipe operator, which takes the output of the "prettier" command and feeds it as input to the "sha256sum" command.
        *   `sha256sum`: This is a command that calculates the SHA256 hash (checksum) of the input it receives.
    *   `2ccd877ded5f031c251d3319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbef7e106a1 *-`: This is the output of the `sha256sum` command. It's the SHA256 hash value of the formatted "README.md" file.  The "\* -" indicates that the input came from standard input (a pipe).

**In Summary:**

The image shows a user running a command in a terminal. The command uses `npx` to run a specific version of `prettier` to format the `README.md` file, and then it calculates and displays the SHA256 checksum of the formatted output.

I ran this directly in the console and got the correct answer.

// Select all

and  elements with the ‘foo’ class  
const fooElements = document.querySelectorAll(“div.foo, span.foo”);

// Initialize a variable to store the sum  
let sum = 0;

// Iterate through the selected elements  
fooElements.forEach(element => {  
// Get the ‘data-value’ attribute and convert it to a number  
const value = parseFloat(element.getAttribute(“data-value”));

// Add the value to the sum  
if (!isNaN(value)) {  
sum += value;  
}  
});

console.log(“Sum of data-value attributes:”, sum);

help me with this
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of instructions and a user's attempt to answer a question. The background is a dark gray/blue color, likely part of a user interface. The text is mainly white, with some elements in blue (a URL) and red (an error message).

**Text and Instructions:**

*   **Instructions:** The image starts with instructions to download a ZIP file named "q-list-files-attributes.zip" and extract it. It suggests using "ls" with options to list files, their dates, and sizes.
*   **Question:** The core question asks: "What's the total size of all files at least 2404 bytes large and modified on or after Mon, 18 Mar, 2002, 1:02 am IST?"
*   **User's Answer:** Below the question, there's a field where the user has entered the number "485969".
*   **Feedback:** The response "Incorrect. Try again." is displayed in red below the attempted answer, indicating the user's answer was wrong.
*   **Important Warning:** A key part of the image is a warning: "Don't copy from inside the ZIP file or use Windows Explorer to unzip. That destroys the timestamps. Extract using unzip, 7-Zip or similar utilities and check the timestamps." This indicates that extracting the ZIP file incorrectly can lead to inaccurate file timestamps, which would affect the answer.

**Graphical Elements:**

*   **URL:** "q-list-files-attributes.zip" is highlighted in blue, implying it's a clickable link to download the file.
*   **Input Box:** The "485969" is within a rounded-corner box, likely a text input field.
*   **Error Icon:** An exclamation mark within a circle (likely red) appears to the right of the incorrect answer, further emphasizing the error.

**In summary:** The image is an interactive element from a task or exercise. It provides instructions, poses a question about file sizes and modification dates, gives the user feedback on their answer, and highlights a crucial step in the process (correct ZIP file extraction) that could affect the answer's accuracy.

Q18 GA1
-------

I don’t get what’s wrong with this:  

image1269×561 42 KB

Can anyone help me understand? Thanks
The image shows a description of a SQLite database table named "tickets" with columns "type", "units", and "price". Each row in the table represents a customer bid for a concert ticket. A sample of the table's data includes rows for "Silver", "gold", and "BRONZE" ticket types with corresponding units and prices.

The image asks for a SQL query to calculate the total sales of all items in the "Gold" ticket type, where "Gold" should be matched case-insensitively and any misspellings or variations like "GOLD", "gold", etc., should be treated as "Gold."

The image also displays the attempted SQL query:
```sql
select sum(units*price)
from tickets
where type='gold' collate nocase;
```

The image indicates that this query resulted in an error. The error message "Error: Got [[124944.59]]..." suggests that the actual answer was expected to be a numeric value.  The provided SQL query attempts to calculate this value using the `sum(units*price)` for rows where `type='gold'` while using case-insensitive collation.

i dont know what is the error is plss guide me
Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Content:** The image appears to be a section from a tutorial or exercise related to using `npx` and `prettier`.

**Text Elements:**

*   **"Let's make sure you know how to use npx and prettier."** This is an introductory statement.
*   **"Download README.md. In the directory where you downloaded it, make sure it is called README.md, and run npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum."** This gives instructions on what to download and what command to run. It instructs the user to download a file named "README.md", navigate to the directory where it was downloaded, and then execute a command involving `npx`, `prettier`, and `sha256sum`.
*   **"What is the output of the command?"** This is a question, implying that the following text is meant to be the output or result of running the aforementioned command.
*   **"SHA256"** This labels the type of checksum displayed.
*   **"AC06784D6825497650083DDFD6746A2CDD561B6A1FF45241C6A354035244A75C"** This appears to be a SHA256 checksum.

**Objects/Features:**

*   **"README.md"** is inside a blue box, that is used as a download button.
*   The text "npx" and "prettier" are colored in pink.
*   The "What is the output of the command" section has a red box around it.
*   There is a circled exclamation point icon on the right side of the red box.

**Overall Interpretation:** The image is part of an educational resource. It likely guides users through downloading a file, using the `prettier` tool through `npx` to format the file, and then asking for the SHA256 checksum of a file, likely to verify its integrity or that it was properly formatted. The question is aimed at having the user understand and verify the output from that formatting process.

I have attempted the quiz, but missed marking this question - I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it. Hope the scores saved would be considered

i am not getting why my answer is showing incorrect.  
can you help me in this ? @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj
The image shows a question or task description related to converting text into a JSON object and then hashing it.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Title:** "Multi-cursor edits to convert to JSON (0.5 marks)"
*   **Instructions:**
    *   Download a file named "q-multi-cursor-json.txt."
    *   Use multiple cursors to edit the file.
    *   Convert the content into a single JSON object, where key-value pairs are converted to the specified JSON format.
    *   Paste the JSON object into the tool at "tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash."
    *   Click the "Hash" button.
*   **Question:**  "What's the result when you paste the JSON at [URL] and click the Hash button?"
*   **Answer Box:** Shows an incorrect answer: "c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536"
*   **Feedback:** "Incorrect. Try again."

In essence, the image presents a coding challenge that involves manipulating text to create a JSON structure and then using a hashing tool to generate a unique identifier (hash) for the resulting JSON.  The provided hash is not the correct one.

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

1. Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
2. Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.

Okay, i will go through my json object once.  
And for hash code i am using chrome only

After passing the deadline , my scores aren’t there …Is it same for all?

image1359×878 78.5 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout and Subject:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an online quiz or assignment. It's designed in a dark color scheme, with text in light colors. The title indicates that it's likely related to "TDS" (possibly a course or program) in January 2025, specifically "GA1 - Development To[ol]".

**Text Elements:**

*   **Deadline:** At the very top, there's a deadline mentioned: "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST." This suggests the assignment had a submission deadline.

*   **"TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development To":** This is the main title, likely indicating the quiz's subject matter.

*   **"Instructions":** This section provides guidelines for completing the quiz.

*   **Instruction Points:**

    1.  **"Learn what you need."** This emphasizes that reading material is available but can be skipped if the questions can be answered directly.

    2.  **"Check answers regularly by pressing Check."**  Indicates that there's a "Check" button to see if answers are correct or incorrect, and it can be used multiple times.

    3.  **"Save regularly by pressing Save."** There's a "Save" button to save progress, and you can save multiple times, with the last submission being evaluated.

    4.  **"Reloading is OK."**  Answers are saved in the browser and are not on the server, and Questions remain unchanged.

    5.  **"Browser may struggle."** Warns that loading issues might occur, suggesting turning off security restrictions or trying a different browser.

    6.  **"Use anything."** Encourages the use of any available resources, like the Internet, ChatGPT, friends, libraries, or frameworks.

    7.  **"It's hackable."** States that it's possible to hack the code to get answers, which is allowed.

*   **"Should you take TDS this term?"** This section offers guidance on whether one should participate in the "TDS" term.

*   **Conditions:**

    *   "If this assignment takes you under 2 hours to complete, you will likely do OK in TDS."
    *   "If you score above 8 / 10, you might get an S or A grade, with effort and luck."

**Objects/Visual Cues:**

*   The words "Check" and "Save" are shown as buttons with corresponding labels.

**Relevant Features:**

*   The emphasis on saving progress regularly and checking answers provides insights into the exam format.
*   The mention of using external resources and the "hackability" statement make it an unorthodox type of quiz, possibly focused more on problem-solving and resourcefulness than rote memorization.
*   The guidelines for success ("under 2 hours", "score above 8/10") provide a way to self-assess one's readiness for the "TDS" term.

Hello Sir,  
I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.

I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of **80 out of 100**. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “**absent**” for this particular assignment.

I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?

Screenshot 2025-02-19 145423961×615 73.7 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**General Layout**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a web page, likely an online assessment platform. It's divided into distinct sections. The color scheme is predominantly dark, with highlights in teal, red, and lighter shades of green.

**Top Section**

*   **Browser Information:** A browser tab is visible at the top, with the URL "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1".
*   **Important Dates/Scores:** A red banner indicates "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST".  Next to this is the "Score: 0" of the exam. Also included are "Check all" and "Save" buttons.

**Interactive Section**

*   **Question Support:** A teal box includes a message bubble icon and the text "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse."

**User Login Information**

*   **Login Status:** The text "You are logged in as" followed by an email-like address "23f3001601@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".
*   **Logout Button:** There's a button labeled "Logout" in a red box.

**Recent Saves History**

*   **Title:** The section is titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)".
*   **Save Details:**
    *   "Reload from 1/27/2025, 12:00:05 AM. Score: 8"
    *   "Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:59:55 PM. Score: 8"
    *   "Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:59:55 PM. Score: 8"

Each save is associated with a "Reload" button, indicating the possibility to revert to that saved state.

**Overall Interpretation**

The image shows a student's status page for an online exam. It displays the exam's end time, the student's current score, their login information, and a history of their saves.  The student has access to a discussion forum for questions. The page indicates that the exam is over, and the current score is 0, while the saved scores are 8.
 Here's a description of the image, focusing on key elements:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a screen capture of a course or educational program announcement. It has a split design:

*   **Top Section:**  This section is dominated by a dark red/maroon background patterned with small circles (polka dots). White text overlays this background.
*   **Bottom Section:** A lighter section with dark gray text, it shows the task or assignment details.

**Text Content (Top Section):**

*   "Tools in Data Science" is prominently displayed in large, white text.
*   "NEW COURSE" appears in smaller white text below the title.

**Text Content (Bottom Section):**

*   "Week 1 Assignment - Absent" This is the label for a task/assignment and seems to indicate a status (likely that the assignment is missed or not completed).

**Color Palette:**

The image has a limited color palette, primarily using:

*   Dark Red/Maroon (for background)
*   White (for the title and "NEW COURSE")
*   Light Gray (for the background of the lower area)
*   Dark Gray (for the "Week 1 Assignment - Absent" text)

**Interpretation:**

The image advertises a new course about tools used in data science, and indicates that the student did not submitted "Week 1 Assignment".
