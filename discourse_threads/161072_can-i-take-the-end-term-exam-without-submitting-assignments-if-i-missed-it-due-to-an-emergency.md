I missed the end-term exam due to an urgent emergency.

The grading assignment indicates I’m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card?

Can I still take the end-term exam and be excused from submitting the assignments and projects?

Yes you dont have to submit your assignments but just give the End term. Just check if you have got the I grade
That's an image of a letter "S" on a dark teal or green background. 


Here's a breakdown:

* **Letter:** A capital letter "S" is centrally positioned.  The font is sans-serif, simple, and clean. The letter is white or light-colored, providing high contrast against the background.

* **Background:** The background is a solid, dark teal or deep green color.  It's uniform and even in tone.

* **Overall:** The image is simple and minimalistic, likely an avatar or icon used for a profile picture, social media, or similar application where a single initial is needed.  The color palette is muted and professional-looking.

Yes, I got I grade, I registered for the courses opting for end term only and not repeating the entire course,

I still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure the new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify

That's a close-up shot of a profile image or avatar. 


Here's a description:

* **Background:** The background is a solid, dark teal or deep green color.

* **Foreground:** The only element in the foreground is a single, uppercase letter "S".  The "S" is white and sans-serif, meaning it doesn't have the small decorative flourishes at the ends of the strokes that serif fonts have.  The font is clean and simple.  The "S" is centered within the image.

The image is likely a user icon or avatar for a profile on a website or app.  The simplicity of the design suggests a modern aesthetic.
