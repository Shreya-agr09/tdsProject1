@24ds3000061 @22f2001532

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

@24ds3000061 @22f2001532

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a low-resolution, somewhat blurry graphic of a stylized play button, strongly resembling the YouTube logo.

**Key Features:**

*   **Shape:** A rounded rectangle with what looks like a "play" button (a triangle pointing to the right) inside.
*   **Color:** The rectangle is predominantly red, while the play button symbol inside is a bright white, suggesting a glowing effect.
*   **Background:** The background is a blurred, muted green color.

**Interpretation:**

This image is very likely a simplified or low-quality representation of the YouTube play button logo. The green background suggests it might be displayed in a setting where the background color is green or it could be part of a larger graphic with a green element.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a Google Meet session. A person is displayed within a circular profile picture against a black background.  The Google Meet logo is in the top right corner, and a name is in the bottom left.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Central Circular Profile:**  A man is visible in the circular frame. He has a beard and short, dark hair. He is wearing a yellow t-shirt with some text on it (difficult to read specifically). The background behind him includes palm trees and a bridge, suggesting an outdoor location.

*   **Google Meet Logo:** The Google Meet logo (the recognizable geometric shape made of green, yellow, and blue) is in the upper right corner.

*   **Name:** "Gokul Vasudevan S" is written in white at the bottom left corner.

*   **Background:** The background is entirely black except for the profile picture and Google Meet logo.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Composition:**

*   The image features a rectangular design, almost like a poster or title card for a video.
*   A dark blue rectangular shape is laid over the image, displaying white text on it.
*   The image is bordered by a tan-colored frame, creating a layered effect.

**Text Elements:**

*   The primary text is "Week 5 Session 1" displayed in large, bold white font.
*   The text appears to be centrally located within the frame.

**Graphic Elements (Background):**

*   The background of the frame is filled with various colorful vector-style illustrations related to data, technology, and analytics. Some examples include:

    *   Diagrams with interconnected nodes or circuits
    *   Bar charts and line graphs
    *   A globe
    *   Pencils
    *   Tablet/screen
    *   Compass
    *   A tool (perhaps a scalpel or blade)
    *   Geometric patterns and shapes.

**Color Palette:**

*   The overall color scheme includes shades of tan, blue, white, and various bright accent colors used within the illustrations.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression**

The image appears to be a title slide or graphic for an educational session, likely online. The dominant feature is the text "Week 5 SESSION 3" superimposed over an array of colorful geometric illustrations.

**Text**

*   The primary text, in large white bold font, reads:
    *   "Week 5"
    *   "SESSION 3"
*   The text is centered and stacked vertically.

**Graphic Elements**

*   **Background Pattern:** The background is a repeating pattern of stylized data-related icons. These include:
    *   Radar chart or target icon
    *   Pencils
    *   A tablet/screen
    *   Network diagrams (nodes and connections)
    *   Bar graphs
    *   Computer screen with lines of text
    *   Globe with connections
    *   Line graphs
    *   Scissors
    *   Pie chart
*   **Color Palette:** The color scheme is modern and vibrant, using a mix of primary and secondary colors, including various shades of blue, red, yellow, green, and peach.
*   **Background Shade:** Dark, shadowy blue shade over the middle of the image.
*   **Border:** the edge is peach in colour, with a dark brown colour that separates the edge from the pattern.

**Composition**

*   The text is overlaid on the background pattern, obscured by a dark shaded rectangle.
*   The entire design is framed, possibly as part of a larger template.
*   The composition feels balanced and clean, with a focus on clarity and visual appeal.

**In summary, the image is a visually engaging title slide indicating that the material being presented is part of Week 5, Session 3 of a larger course or program, likely related to data, technology, or analysis.**

@22f2000559

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.  
(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem )
Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Content:** The image features a single emoji, specifically the "Rolling on the Floor Laughing" emoji.

**Key Features:**

*   **Facial Expression:** The emoji depicts a yellow face tilted to one side, indicating extreme amusement or laughter. The eyes are represented by curved lines (similar to squints), suggesting they are squeezed shut from laughter.
*   **Mouth:** The mouth is wide open in a hearty laugh, with a visible tongue and teeth.
*   **Tears of Joy:** Two large, blue teardrops are emanating from the eyes, signifying that the laughter is so intense that the person is crying with joy.
*   **Color:** The overall color scheme is bright and cheerful, with a yellow face and blue teardrops. The background is black.

**Overall Impression:** The image clearly conveys a feeling of immense amusement, mirth, or hilarity. It's a common emoji used to express that something is incredibly funny.

Other than the GA2 and GA3 the scores are showing sir.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.14.23 PM650×652 40.5 KB

Here sir for me it is showing absent for GA2 but for others the score is showing.
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout**

The image appears to be a screen capture of an online course presentation, possibly from a learning management system or a course website. It's divided into two main sections: a decorative header and a content section with assignment details.

**Header Section**

*   **Text:** The header contains the title "Tools in Data Science" in a large, white font. Below it, "NEW COURSE" is written in a slightly smaller, also white font.
*   **Background:** The background of the header is dark brown with a subtle pattern of small dots or circles, creating a textured effect. There are curved areas with color gradients, adding depth and visual interest.

**Content Section**

*   **Assignment Information:** This section lists four weeks of assignments and their corresponding status or score:
    *   "Week 1 Assignment - 100.00"
    *   "Week 2 Assignment - Absent"
    *   "Week 3 Assignment - 85.00"
    *   "Week 4 Assignment - 60.00"
    The font color in this section is a dark gray.

*   **Call to Action Button:** At the bottom of the section, there is a call to action with the text "Go to Course page >". It is positioned inside a light gray bordered area, possibly designed as a button to redirect the user to the course page. The text is dark red.

**Overall Impression**

The image conveys a sense of course information, specifically related to "Tools in Data Science." The assignment details provide a snapshot of progress, and the call to action button encourages further engagement with the course material. The design is clean and professional, with a focus on readability and clear information presentation.

Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on text and key features:

**Overall Layout and Theme:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of an online assignment or quiz interface. The color scheme is predominantly dark with green accents, giving it a modern and technical feel.
*   There's a red bar at the top, which usually indicates important information or a status message.

**Textual Information and Key Elements:**

*   **Deadline:** The top left of the screen reads "Ended at Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". This indicates a deadline for the assignment or quiz.
*   **Score:** Near the deadline is the text "Score: 0", indicating the current score of the user.
*   **Controls:** Next to the score, "Check all" and "Save" buttons are present, indicating options to save the current progress or check the answers.
*   **Bonus Opportunity:** There's a section titled "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse". It states that IITM BS students who participate in the discussion on "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" by asking or answering questions will receive 1 bonus mark.
*   **Login Information:** The user is logged in as "23f1002510@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". A "Logout" button is provided.
*   **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" shows the recent save history:
    *   "Reload from 09/02/2025, 23:59:45. Score: 2"
    *   "Reload from 09/02/2025, 23:56:35. Score: 2"
    *   "Reload from 09/02/2025, 23:44:29. Score: 2"
    This indicates the user has saved the assignment multiple times, with a score of 2 in each instance.

**Additional Observations:**

*   The interface seems to be designed for a course or assignment related to data sourcing, potentially within the IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) context.
*   The presence of a "Discourse" link suggests a forum or discussion board component to the course.
*   The time zone is specified as "IST" (Indian Standard Time).
*   The Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom, showing the current time as "19:29 18-02-2025", and the keyboard is set to "ENG".

In summary, the image displays an online assignment interface related to a Data Sourcing course at IITM, showing a deadline, bonus opportunity for forum participation, user login information, and save history, with the user's current score being 0 and most recent saves showing a score of 2.

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a table or spreadsheet displaying data. Each row likely represents a record, with different data fields arranged in columns.

**Textual Content and Interpretation:**

Here's what we can extract and interpret from the text in each column:

*   **Column 1:** `tds-2025-01-gal` This likely represents an identifier or code, possibly indicating a type of data (TDS = Tax Deducted at Source?), a year (2025), and a subtype or group ('gal'). The values appear to be consistent.
*   **Column 2:** `22f3000935@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` This strongly resembles an email address. The `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` suggests it belongs to a student or researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) doing some sort of study or research. The "22f3000935" portion is probably a student or user ID.
*   **Column 3:** Dates and Timestamps:
    *   `2025-01-27 00:00:23`
    *   `2025-01-26 23:59:01`
    These indicate date and time information. In the first two rows, the timestamp is 00:00:23 on January 27, 2025.  The last two rows have a timestamp of 23:59:01 on January 26, 2025.
*   **Column 4:** Numerical Values: `7.75` and `7` These seem to be numerical values or scores. It can be a quantity, amount, or measurement.
*   **Column 5:** Numerical Value: `10` This probably represents an integer value.

**Possible Interpretation:**

Without more context, it's difficult to say definitively what this data represents. However, here's a possible interpretation:

*   It could be records of some process or activity occurring on or around January 2025.
*   The records are potentially related to someone at IITM (based on the email).
*   The numerical values represent some sort of measurement or score associated with each activity.
*   The last value '10' indicates possibly a rate.

because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence.

Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a table displaying quiz results. The table has the following columns:

*   **Quiz:** Shows the quiz name which is the same for both entries: "tds-2025-01-ga3"
*   **Email:** Shows the email address, "21f3000745@ds.study.iitm.ac.in", which is the same for both entries.
*   **Time:** Displays the submission time. The first entry shows "2025-02-06 18:53:58", and the second shows "2025-02-05 22:01:38".
*   **Total:** Indicates the total score. The first entry has a score of 7, and the second has a score of 6.
*   **Max:** Indicates the maximum possible score, which is 9.5 for both entries.

In summary, the table shows two quiz attempts from the same email address, with different submission times and scores, but both out of a maximum possible score of 9.5.

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

The image displays a section of what appears to be a course grading or assessment report.

**Module 1:**

-   **Submission Status:** "Submitted" in green confirms that the assignment has been submitted.
-   **Your Score:** The score for the assignment is "100". There is a "View Chart" option below.
-   **Peer Average:**  The average score among peers is "99%". There is a "View Chart" option below.
-   **Median Score:** The median score is "100".

**Module 2:**
- Title: "Module 2: Deployment Tools" is the title of the module. There is a downward-pointing chevron, likely indicating the section is currently collapsed.

Overall, the image segment shows a student's performance on an assignment within Module 1 of a course, along with comparative data from other students.  Module 2 is also listed as well, but collapsed.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

        *   Week 3: 100.00
        *   Week 4: 100.00
    *   Call to Action: "Go to Course page >"

@23f2004320

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.

Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.

The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.

Kind regards.

Sir for the GA3 the saved score says its 4.5, total is 9.5 so my total should be 47.4.

According to your submission history your last submission before the deadline was 3.5 (i.e. your score would be 36.8 out of 100)

Kind regards
The image presents a tabular data display, likely from a spreadsheet or database. It includes three rows of information, with several columns:

- The first column appears to be an identifier or name, all entries are "tds-2025-01-ga3".

- The second column consists of email addresses, all in the format "23f1002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".

- The third column presents date and time information, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". The values are: "2025-02-06 01:13:34", "2025-02-06 00:22:25", and "2025-02-05 23:59:07".

- The fourth column contains numerical values, specifically "4.5", "4.5", and "3.5".

- The final column also contains numerical values, all entries are "9.5".

The data appears to be structured and consistent, which suggests it is an organized data table.

Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab.  
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Context:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an online assignment or exam interface, likely from a course at IIT Madras. The user is logged in, and the assignment ("Graded Assignment 2") is labeled "TDS 2025 Jan GA2."

**Key Elements and Text:**

*   **Top Bar:**
    *   Browser tabs: "Graded Assignment 2 = IITM On...", "TDS 2025 Jan GA2 - Deployment...", "TDS 2025 Jan GAS - Data Prepa..."
    *   URL: "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2"
    *   Links: "IIT Madras Online D...", "Replit", "The Open Notes", "IITM-PDS - Data Sci..."
*   **Red Warning Banner:**  "Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and "Score: 0". There are "Check all" and "Save" buttons.
*   **Login Information:** "You are logged in as 22f1001901@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
*   **Logout Button:** A button labeled "Logout".
*   **Recent Saves:** A section titled "Recent saves" with the subtitle "(most recent is your official score)". It shows the history of the user's saves with timestamps and scores:
    *   "Reload" from 2/3/2025, 12:00:30 AM. Score: 8
    *   "Reload" from 2/2/2025, 11:53:32 PM. Score: 8
    *   "Reload" from 2/2/2025, 11:53:30 PM. Score: 8
*   **Questions:** The beginning of a section titled "Questions" and lists the first two questions.
    1.  "Write documentation in Markdown (1 mark)"
    2.  "Compress an image (1 mark)"

**Interpretation:**

*   The assignment is past its deadline ("Ended at Sun, 2 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST").
*   The current displayed score is 0.
*   The system keeps a history of saves, indicating that the user previously had a score of 8 on earlier attempts, but the latest shown score is 0.
*   The user can potentially reload an earlier save, although it is unclear if it will be allowed after the deadline.
*   The first two questions are visible and are worth 1 mark each.

In summary, the image shows a student's view of an online assignment that has passed its deadline with a current score of 0, but with previous saves showing a score of 8.

@shubham6 I have checked the backend server. It does show your score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you.

Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are) thanks.
