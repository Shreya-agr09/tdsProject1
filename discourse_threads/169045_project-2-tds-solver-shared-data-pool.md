Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread
==========================================

### Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments

### Why?

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?

### Too many Questions for LLM

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

### What We need from YOU 🫵🏽

Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?

### How?

* If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
* If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful

### Where?

That's a digital image of an exclamation point (!) and a question mark (?) rendered in a pixel art style. 


Here's a breakdown of the image's features:

* **Style:** The image uses a low-resolution, pixelated aesthetic reminiscent of early video games or simple digital art.  The pixels are clearly visible.

* **Color:** The characters are a bright, slightly glossy red.  The exclamation point has two small, red dots underneath it, while the question mark also has a small red dot underneath. The background is transparent.

* **Characters:** The main focus is the exclamation point and question mark positioned side-by-side.  The question mark is slightly larger than the exclamation point.  The combination of these two characters suggests uncertainty or surprise.


The image is simple but effectively conveys a feeling of questioning and exclamation or surprise.
 That's an emoji depicting a yellow face in thought. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **The Face:** The main part is a round, bright yellow circle representing the face. It has a slightly furrowed brow, indicated by two short, dark brown lines above the eyes. 

* **The Eyes:** The eyes are small, dark brown circles, slightly slanted downward, contributing to the pensive expression.

* **The Mouth:** The mouth is a thin, downward-curving line, further emphasizing the thoughtful or slightly skeptical mood.

* **The Hand:** A small, yellow hand is positioned to the left of the face, with the index finger touching the cheek or chin, a common gesture signifying thoughtfulness or contemplation.  The hand is simplified, not realistically detailed.

* **Overall Style:** The style is cartoonish and simplistic, consistent with most common emoji designs. The lines are somewhat pixelated or blocky.


The overall impression is one of thoughtful consideration, perhaps even slight skepticism or uncertainty.  There's no text present.
 That's an emoji! 


Specifically, it's a yellow, circular emoticon with a wide, open smile that shows its tongue slightly. It's wearing black-framed glasses that sit atop the emoji's face.  The eyes are simple, dark brown circles. The overall style is a cheerful, slightly nerdy or intelligent expression.  The image is digitally rendered, with a pixelated quality visible upon close examination.  There's no text present.

 That's a pixel art image of a thumbs-up gesture. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Style:** The image is clearly in a pixel art style, meaning it's composed of individual squares (pixels) to create the image.  The resolution is low, resulting in a somewhat blocky and less detailed appearance compared to a photorealistic image.

* **Color Palette:** The color palette is simple, using shades of light brown/tan for the skin tone. There's no significant shading or highlighting, contributing to the simplistic nature of the pixel art.

* **Gesture:** The image depicts a hand giving a thumbs-up, a universally recognized gesture of approval, agreement, or positivity. The thumb is extended upwards, while the other fingers are curled into a fist.

* **Background:** The background is transparent, making it suitable for use as an overlay or icon on other images or backgrounds.


Overall, it's a simple, easily understandable depiction of a thumbs-up gesture, ideal for use as a positive symbol or emoticon in digital contexts.

Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Style:** The image is clearly in a pixel art style, meaning it's composed of distinct squares of color rather than smooth gradients or detailed shading.  The low resolution contributes to its retro or simplistic aesthetic.

* **Color Palette:** The colors are limited and muted.  The skin tone is a light brownish beige.  There's no strong contrast or bright highlights.

* **Shape and Form:** The hand is depicted in a fairly straightforward manner. The thumb is extended upward, and the fingers are curled into a fist. The proportions are somewhat simplified, characteristic of pixel art.  There's no attempt at photorealism.

This time I’ll create a functioning script way before deadline for everyone to use .
That's the Jolly Roger, the pirate flag of Monkey D. Luffy and his Straw Hat Pirates from the popular anime and manga series *One Piece*.

The image shows a black flag with a white skull wearing a straw hat, a common symbol of piracy. The skull's hat has a red band. The skull has large, round, black eyes and a wide, grinning mouth. Two large white bones form a cross behind the skull. The flag is blowing in the wind, attached to a wooden mast against a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The style is consistent with the animation of the *One Piece* series.

That's a digital image of a red "X" symbol. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Shape and Color:** The X is formed by two thick, slightly rounded lines intersecting at the center. The color is a vibrant, somewhat glossy red.  The redness suggests a sense of urgency, error, or negation.

* **Style:** The style is simple and cartoonish, not photorealistic. The slightly rounded edges and 3D-like shading give it a plump or bouncy appearance, making it look less harsh than a simple, flat X.

* **Likely Purpose:** This type of X is commonly used in digital interfaces as a button or indicator to signify cancellation, deletion, closing, or rejection of something.  Its visual design makes it easily recognizable as a negative or dismissable action.
 That's an image of a simple checkmark graphic. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape:** The overall shape is a square with slightly rounded corners, giving it a button-like appearance.

* **Color:** The square's background is a light, slightly desaturated green.

* **Checkmark:** A large, bold, white checkmark (or tick) is prominently displayed in the center of the green square. The checkmark is drawn with a slightly uneven, hand-drawn style, rather than perfectly smooth lines. 

* **Style:** The overall style is simple, clean, and cartoonish. It looks like a graphic element that might be used in a user interface (UI), website, or app to indicate completion, confirmation, or a correct answer.  There is a subtle slight shadowing effect implying depth and suggesting it's a 3D-like button.

That's a pixel art image depicting a red exclamation point (!) next to a red question mark (?). 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **Style:** The image is clearly pixel art, meaning it's made up of individual squares of color, giving it a retro or game-like appearance.  The pixels are relatively large, making the image low-resolution.

* **Color:** The entire image is in shades of red, with a slightly darker red used for shading to give the characters a three-dimensional, slightly glossy effect.

* **Characters:**  A large, bold exclamation point is positioned to the left of a large, bold question mark. Both are rendered in the same style and color.

* **Additional Elements:** Small red dots are placed under each punctuation mark, likely intended as a stylistic choice to emphasize them further, resembling small exclamation/question marks.

* **Overall Impression:** The combination of the exclamation and question marks, coupled with the slightly cartoonish pixel art style, suggests a sense of urgency, surprise, or perhaps even playful confusion.  It could be used in a video game, as an icon, or in other digital contexts where visual communication is paramount.

That's a close-up image of a stylized red "X" mark, commonly used as a symbol for deletion, cancellation, or negation. 


Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:

* **Shape and Color:** The "X" is formed by two thick, slightly rounded lines intersecting at the center. The color is a vibrant, slightly glossy red, suggesting a three-dimensional effect. The edges are not perfectly sharp; there's a subtle softening or beveling.

* **Style:** The style is simple, cartoonish, or perhaps slightly "game-like," suggesting it might be used in a user interface (UI) or within a game's graphics.  It avoids being overly realistic.

* **Background:** The background is transparent (or black, depending on the viewer's background). This is common for icons and symbols designed for various applications where they need to blend with different contexts.

In short, the image is a clear and easily recognizable representation of an "X" mark designed for digital use.
 That's an image of a checkmark inside a square. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:
