Hi @Sakshi6479,

You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.

We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.

That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.

Kind regards

**Body:**  The main text explains the conditions for earning the bonus mark:

* **Target Audience:**  IITM BS students (presumably students from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Bachelor of Science program).
* **Activity:** They must reply to a specific discussion thread on Discourse.
* **Discussion Thread Details:** The thread is titled "GA4-Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]".  This suggests the discussion is about Google Analytics 4 data sourcing and was created in January 2025.
* **Requirement:** The reply must contain a relevant question or answer to be considered for the bonus.
* **Reward:**  One bonus mark will be added to the grade of the assignment.

The overall purpose of the text is to encourage class participation and discussion among students on a designated online platform.
