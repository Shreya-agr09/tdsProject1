Good Morning Sir,

This is my github repo: GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS\_Project\_1 ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)

I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me. Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.  
@carlton
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image is a screenshot of an email. The email is addressed to "Dear Learner" and discusses the prerequisites for "Project 1."

**Key Elements and Text:**

*   **Heading:** "Dear Learner,"
*   **Project Introduction:** The email states that Project 1 requires passing pre-requisite checks, detailed on the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" page.
*   **Prerequisites List:**
    1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    2.  GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
    3.  GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
    4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a podman command (detailed in the text).
    5.  Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.
*   **Warning:** If the minimum requirements are not met, the submission will not be evaluated.
*   **Evaluation Results:** This is the most important section, as it shows the results of the prerequisite checks:
    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"

**Visual Cues:**

*   The word "Dockerfile" is styled with a different font, probably a monospaced font.

**In summary, the email outlines the requirements for Project 1, lists the criteria that need to be met, and then presents the results of an evaluation, indicating that the learner has only passed the check for the Docker image being present and public but failed the GitHub repository being present and public, the Dockerfile, and the MIT license checks.**
 Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text and relevant features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a screenshot of an email or a document outlining the evaluation of a docker image submission. It's a formal communication, likely from an educational or assessment context, informing a "Learner" about the results of their submission.

**Text Breakdown:**

*   **Heading/Salutation:** "Dear Learner,"

*   **Introductory Paragraph:** States the evaluation of project 1 docker image submission. It informs the recipient that the following files are attached or linked.

*   **"MISSING" Clarification:** Explains the significance of "MISSING" in the context of the evaluation: it means the evaluation didn't run due to a misconfigured docker image, leading to a score of 0.

*   **Responsiveness Requirement:** States that the docker image should become responsive in 5 minutes. Failure to do so results in the image not being considered.

*   **Server Details:** Provides information about the server environment: 8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit and 1 Gigabit network bandwidth. This is to assure that the environment was not the cause for performance issues.

*   **List of Files and Links:**
    *   **Evaluation Log File:** A Google Drive link (`https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BaAw2x6g2YBRDgt-GoZS1UbGSSBafnQ/view?usp=drivesdk`). Describes it as containing a performance report on individual tasks.
    *   **Docker Log File:** A Google Drive link (`https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aFya6jG3YF1UrahQu7qnCbEOaDh4JW27/view?usp=drivesdk`). Describes it as providing the technical performance of the container.
    *   **Server Start Log File:** (See attachment).  Logs related to the server startup, separated for arm vs x86 architectures. Notes that if the docker service did not start or respond, it would be recorded here.
    *   **Evaluation Script File:** (See attachment).  The actual tests run against the submission and the scoring mechanism. Separated for arm vs x86 architectures.
    *   **Data Generation File:** (See attachment). The evaluation file depends on this file to create the data for the tasks.
    *   **Docker Orchestration File:** (See attachment). Handles retrieval, launching, and setting environment variables and port mappings for the container.
    *   **Solution Script:** (See attachment zip). A solution to the entire project, emphasizing prompt engineering.

*   **Docker Image ID:**  "This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 48299f48f66b"

*   **Scores and Feedback:** Indicates that the scores are preliminary and reflect the current evaluation standards. It encourages reporting bugs or discrepancies in the scripts. Provides a deadline (Tuesday) for reporting issues. Mentions a final marking schema and normalization based on the highest scores. Apologizes for the delay.

*   **Call to Action:** "Post all your concerns on this discourse thread"

**Key Features:**

*   **File Links:** Two Google Drive links are provided, which are likely accessible reports.
*   **Attachments:** Several files are mentioned as attachments, suggesting a need for further files beyond the linked documents.
*   **Scoring Caveats:** The communication explicitly states that the scores are not final and are subject to change based on feedback and adjustments.
*   **Feedback Encouragement:** The message encourages the recipient to provide feedback and report any issues found in the scripts.

In essence, the image showcases a detailed evaluation feedback form, combining linked reports, attached files, and textual explanations regarding performance, scoring, and the opportunity for further feedback.

Apologies for that,

The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.

Kind regards

Hi @carlton,

I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

First Evaluation Email1511×724 76.2 KB

  

Second Evaluation Email1247×681 37.5 KB

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:  
GitHub repo

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi,

Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Thank You So much sir
Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the text and key features:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a terminal output log from a Docker build and run process. It captures the process of building a Docker image, tagging it, and then running it. We see the steps involved in the build, the image layers being exported, and finally the startup of the application within the Docker container.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **Docker Build Log:**

    *   The initial lines (`=> => sha256: ...`) are part of the Docker image build process. Docker pulls and extracts pre-existing image layers based on their SHA256 hashes.  These lines show the layers being downloaded and extracted, including their sizes.
    *   `=> [internal] load build context`: Indicates the start of the user's build context being loaded.
    *   `=> transferring context: 9.24kB`:  Shows the size of the build context being transferred to the Docker daemon.
    *   `=> [2/5] WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
    *   `=> [3/5] COPY . /app`: Copies files and directories from the host machine to the `/app` directory in the container.
    *   `=> [4/5] COPY requirements.txt /app/`: Copies the `requirements.txt` file to the `/app` directory in the container.
    *   `=> [5/5] RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`: Executes the `pip install` command inside the container to install Python dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`. The `--no-cache-dir` option is used to avoid caching pip packages.
    *   `=> exporting to image`: Signals that the image is being packaged up.
    *   `=> exporting layers`: Indicates that Docker is writing out the layers that make up the image.
    *   `=> exporting manifest sha256: ...`
    *   `=> exporting config sha256: ...`
    *   `=> exporting attestation manifest sha256: ...`
    *   `=> exporting manifest list sha256: ...`: Display the SHA256 hashes of the image manifest, configuration, and attestation.
    *   `=> naming to docker.io/library/sha256: ...`: Displays the repository the image is being named to in Docker Hub.
    *   `=> unpacking to docker.io/library/sha256: ...`: Displays that the image is being unpacked on the Docker Hub registry.

2.  **Build Details Link:**

    *   `View build details: docker-desktop://dashboard/build/desktop-linux/desktop-linux/4btzhep5n0ttsar3bibf4z96c`: Provides a link to view the Docker build details in the Docker Desktop dashboard.  This could be useful for more in-depth analysis.

3.  **Docker Run Command:**

    *   `C:\SSNFun\IITM\sudhishssn134-project_1_tds-b240fec>docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586649`: This line shows the command used to run the Docker image. Let's break it down:
        *   `docker run`: The Docker command to create and run a container.
        *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`: Sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN`. The value is being passed from the host environment.
        *   `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container. This allows access to the application running inside the container.
        *   `sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586649`: Specifies the image to run, identified by its SHA256 digest.

4.  **Application Startup Messages:**

    *   `INFO: Started server process [1]`: Indicates that the server process has started within the container.
    *   `INFO: Waiting for application startup.`: A message indicating the server is initializing.
    *   `INFO: Application startup complete.`: Confirms that the application is ready to serve requests.
    *   `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`: Shows that Uvicorn, a Python ASGI server, is running the application on port 8000. The message also tells the user how to stop the server.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The image demonstrates a typical Docker build and run workflow.
*   The application is likely a Python application using the Uvicorn ASGI server.
*   Port 8000 is being exposed to allow access to the application from the host machine.
*   An environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is being used to configure the application.

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a command-line terminal output, likely from a software development or deployment process.  It depicts the build and execution of a Docker container.

**Key Sections and their Content:**

1.  **Docker Build Process:**
    *   The top part of the image shows the output of a `docker build` command. This involves creating a container image from a Dockerfile.
    *   Lines starting with `=>` indicate steps in the Dockerfile, such as downloading layers from a registry, extracting files, copying files into the container, and running commands (like `pip install`).
    *   `[2/5]`, `[3/5]`, etc. show the progress through steps defined in the Dockerfile.
    *   Specific actions include:
        *   Extracting layers from images identified by their SHA256 hashes.
        *   Transferring context (likely the files and directories in the current project).
        *   Setting the working directory inside the container (`WORKDIR /app`).
        *   Copying files (`COPY . /app` and `COPY requirements.txt /app`).
        *   Installing Python dependencies using `pip` (`RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`).
        *   Exporting the resulting image and layers.
        *   Naming the image and unpacking it to docker.io.
    *   The build process also shows time taken for individual steps.

2.  **Build Details URL:**
    *   `View build details: docker-desktop://dashboard/build/desktop-linux/desktop-linux/4btzhep5n0ttsar3bibf4z96c` provides a link (presumably to Docker Desktop's interface) to view more detailed information about the build.

3.  **Docker Run Command:**
    *   `C:\SSNFun\IITM\sudhishssn134-project_1_tds-b240fec>docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586b49` shows the command to run the created Docker image.
    *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN` sets an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN` within the container.
    *   `-p 8000:8000` maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container. This allows accessing a service running within the container on the host.
    *   `sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586b49` specifies the image to run, identified by its SHA256 hash.

4.  **Application Startup Logs:**
    *   `INFO: Started server process [1]`
    *   `INFO: Waiting for application startup.`
    *   `INFO: Application startup complete.`
    *   `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`
    These lines indicate that a server (likely a web application) has started inside the container using Uvicorn (an ASGI server implementation). It's listening on port 8000 inside the container, which is mapped to port 8000 on the host machine.

**Inference and Potential Questions:**

*   **Project Type:** This looks like a Python-based web application using Uvicorn.
*   **Dependencies:** The `requirements.txt` file suggests the application has external dependencies.
*   **Dockerization:** The user is Dockerizing their application to run it consistently across different environments.
*   **Port Mapping:** The `-p 8000:8000` suggests that the application running inside the container is a web service that can be accessed on the host machine through port 8000.

In essence, the image captures the steps of building a Docker image for a Python application, running the image, and the application starting successfully within the container.

URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 Tools in Data Science

> Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation.
> Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.

Previous Correct Evaluation Mail:  

Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-02-351687×650 144 KB

Good Morning Sir,

This is my github repo: GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS\_Project\_1 ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)

I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me. Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.  
@carlton
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an email or a webpage displaying feedback on a project. The initial part is a message to the "Learner" explaining the prerequisite checks for "Project 1".  Following this is a list of specific evaluation checks and their results.

**Text Content (Specifics):**

*   **Greeting:** "Dear Learner,"
*   **Project Requirement:** "Project 1 requires you to pass some pre-requisite checks as detailed on the TDS Project 1: Evaluation page:" (with "TDS Project 1: Evaluation" being a link).
*   **Prerequisites (numbered list):**

    1.  "Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible"
    2.  "Your GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license"
    3.  "Your GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile"
    4.  "Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via podman run -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE\_NAME"
    5.  "Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository"
*   **Warning:** "If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated."
*   **Evaluation Title:** "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:"
*   **Evaluation Results (list):**

    *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS"
    *   "Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL"
    *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL"
    *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL"

**Key Observations:**

*   The learner has passed the check related to the Docker image being present in Docker Hub and being publicly accessible.
*   The learner has failed the checks related to:
    *   GitHub repository being present and public.
    *   Dockerfile being present in the root of the GitHub repository.
    *   MIT License being present in the root of the GitHub repository.

**In essence, the image shows a status report on the learner's project. While the Docker image is set up correctly, there are issues with the GitHub repository, specifically its presence/public accessibility and the presence of the Dockerfile and MIT license in its root directory.**
 Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on the text content and its key features:

**Overall Content:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of an email or document providing feedback on a project submission, specifically a Docker image.  The content is formal and instructional, providing both positive feedback and areas for potential improvement.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Header:** "Dear Learner," indicating the recipient is a student or participant.

*   **Evaluation Announcement:** The text starts by announcing the evaluation of the project 1 Docker image submission and informs the recipient that the following files are attached.

*   **Missing Files Warning:** "MISSING" is written in uppercase, indicating that at least one file was missing from the submission. It states that "MISSING indicates that the file is not available because the evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured. If you feel this is in error you can still contact us." It also warns that "MISSING files will result in a score of 0."

*   **Responsiveness Requirement:**  Specifies a performance expectation: "Your docker image is supposed to become responsive in 5 minutes from launch. If it does not, then we will not consider it." It also mentions that the evaluation environment consists of 8-core Xeon Google Cloud compute units with 1 Gigabit network bandwidth to ensure the server performance is not a bottleneck.

*   **List of Files (with Descriptions):** A numbered list of files provided as part of the evaluation:

    1.  **Evaluation log file:** A Google Drive link is provided (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BaAw2x6g2YBRDgt-GoZS1UbGSSBafnQ/view?usp=drivesdk). It's described as containing "your performance report on your individual tasks."
    2.  **Docker log file:** Another Google Drive link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aFya6jG3YF1UrahQu7qnCbEOaDh4JW27/view?usp=drivesdk). It "provides the technical performance of your container."
    3.  **Server start log file:** It contains separate logs for arm vs x86.
    4.  **Evaluation script file:** It contains separate logs for arm vs x86.
    5.  **Data generation file:** The evaluation file depends on this file to create the data for the tasks.
    6.  **Docker orchestration file:** This file handles the retrieval of your docker image from docker hub and launching of your container instance.
    7.  **Solution script:** This file solves the entire project 1 using prompt engineering only.

*   **Docker Image ID:** The text provides the ID of the evaluated Docker image: 48299f48f66b.

*   **Feedback and Improvement Opportunity:** The writer notes that the scores are not final and indicates openness to feedback and bug reports. They specify a deadline (Tuesday) for reporting issues to potentially adjust the score. They also mention they will be considering the highest scores (including the sample script score) in deciding how to normalize the remaining scores. The section ends with an apology for the delay and an invitation to provide feedback.

*   **Final Instruction:** The instruction "Post all your concerns on this discourse thread" indicates the preferred method of communication.

**Overall Tone:**

The tone of the document is professional, constructive, and encouraging. It seeks to provide helpful feedback and allow the learner to improve their score.

Apologies for that,

The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.

Kind regards

Hi @carlton,

I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

1. The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
2. The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

First Evaluation Email1511×724 76.2 KB

  

Second Evaluation Email1247×681 37.5 KB

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:  
GitHub repo

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance!
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text and relevant features:

**Overall Content:**

The image is a screenshot of an email message. The email is titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores".  It appears to be an evaluation of a project submission related to Docker images.

**Header Information:**

*   **Title:** TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores
*   **Sender:** 22t1 se2002 (email address: se2002@studyitm.ac.in)
*   **Recipient:** "to me" (presumably the person who took the screenshot)
*   **Date:** Mar 29, 2025, 12:21 AM (6 days ago)

**Email Body:**

The email body can be broken down into sections:

*   **Greeting:** "Dear Learner,"

*   **Important Note about Missing Files:** "MISSING indicates that the file is not available because the evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured. If you feel this is in error you can still contact us. MISSING files will result in a score of 0."
*   **Performance Expectations:** "Your docker image is supposed to become responsive in 5 minutes from launch. If it does not, then we will not consider it. The images were all run on an 8 core Xeon Google Cloud compute unit. So performance of the server was not a bottleneck for your docker image. Also each docker image had 1 Gigabit of dedicated network bandwidth available which is nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet."
*   **List of Evaluation Files:**  A numbered list of files is provided with links and descriptions.
    1.  **Evaluation log file:**  (Link to a Google Drive file).  Description: "This contains your performance report on your individual tasks."
    2.  **Docker log file:** (Link to a Google Drive file). Description: "This provides the technical performance of your container."
    3.  **Server start log file:** (See attachment). Description: "If your docker service did not start or respond to attempts to our requests."
    4.  **Evaluation script file:** (See attachment). Description: "This file has the actual tests that were run against your submission and the scoring mechanism."
    5.  **Data generation file:** (See attachment). Description: "The evaluation file depends on this file to create the data for the tasks."
    6.  **Docker orchestration file:** (See attachment). Description: "This file handles the retrieval of your docker image from docker hub and launching of your container instance. It also sends the required environment variables that will be required by your container to function and the port mappings for communications."
    7.  **Solution script:** (See attachment zip). Description: "This file solves the entire project 1 using prompt engineering only. This is a sample example of what can be achieved by leveraging the core concepts of LLMs to achieve the desired result."
*   **Docker Image ID:** "This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: b0d89eee9b17"
*   **Disclaimer about Scores:** "These scores are not final but they indicate what our current evaluation standards will score you."
*   **Opportunity to Report Issues:** "If you have discovered a bug in our scripts or have a discrepancy to report with how the various scripts functions then we are happy to address your concern and where necessary make amendments to your score."
*   **Deadline:** "You will have until Tuesday to report any problems. After which the score will be considered final. We will listen to feedback and then come up with a final marking schema."

**Important Features to note:**

*   The repeated phrase "(See attachment)" indicates that several files are attached to the email.
*   The URLs are specifically for Google Drive files.
*   The email emphasizes the importance of a responsive Docker image within a specified timeframe.
*   There is a clear offer to address concerns or discrepancies in the evaluation.
*   A specific deadline is provided for reporting issues.
 Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Impression:**
The image is a screenshot of an email. The email is titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores" and appears to be an automated notification about the results of prerequisite checks for a coding project. The sender is "22t1 se2002 <se2002@study.iitm.ac.in>". It was sent on Tuesday, April 1st at 1:25 AM, about 3 days ago.

**Email Body Analysis:**

*   **Salutation:** The email begins with a polite "Dear Learner,".
*   **Project Requirements:** It states that Project 1 has certain prerequisite checks. These checks are detailed on a link "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page".
*   **Listing of Requirements:**
    *   The email lists the following requirements as numbered points:
        1.  GitHub repository existence and public accessibility.
        2.  A LICENSE file with the MIT license in the repository.
        3.  A valid Dockerfile in the repository.
        4.  A Docker image that is publicly accessible and runnable using a podman command. The command includes environment variables and port mapping.
        5.  The Docker image using the same Dockerfile as the GitHub repository.
*   **Consequences of Failure:** The email states that failure to meet these minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.
*   **Evaluation Results:**
    *   The email then presents the results of the prerequisite evaluations:
        *   "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public": PASS.
        *   "Is Github repo present AND public": FAIL.
        *   "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo": FAIL.
        *   "Is MIT license present at root of github repo": FAIL.
*   **Final Verdict:**
    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL" indicates the overall status of the prerequisites is a failure.
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0" shows that the project received a score of 0.

**Other elements:**
*   At the top of the email, there is an icon (likely a default profile picture) of a user.
*   The email subject line has an "Inbox" label with a small 'x' icon next to it.

**In summary:** The email indicates that a student ("Learner") has failed the initial prerequisite checks for "Project 1" due to issues with their GitHub repository (not being public, missing a Dockerfile, and missing an MIT license). Although the Docker image appears to be correctly set up, the failed prerequisites result in a score of 0.

Hi,

Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?

My GitHub repository for Project-1: GitHub - sudhishssn134/project\_1\_tds

Thanking You

Just attaching the mail I recieved.

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:

`tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())`

You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a medium close-up of a man's face. He is wearing glasses and a purple shirt. The background is a plain, light yellow or cream color.

**Key Features:**

*   **Man:**
    *   He has short, dark hair neatly styled to the side.
    *   He is wearing rectangular framed glasses.
    *   His skin tone appears to be light to medium.
    *   He seems to be smiling slightly.
*   **Clothing:**
    *   He is wearing a solid purple button-down shirt. Only a portion of the shirt is visible.
*   **Background:**
    *   The background is a simple, solid color, likely a light yellow or cream. It doesn't provide any context or details.

**In summary,** the image is a straightforward headshot of a man with glasses wearing a purple shirt against a plain background. There are no visible words, symbols, or other objects beyond those described.

As I dont have evaluate.py

But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir.  
Please guide me after this sir  
Thank You So much sir
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Image:**
The image is a screenshot of a terminal window. It shows a sequence of build commands and related information, followed by a command to run a Docker container and logs from an application starting up.

**Top Section: Docker Build Output**
The top portion of the image presents the output of a Docker build process. Notable elements include:
   - Arrow "=>" indicators showing steps in the build process.
   - "sha256:" prefixes followed by long hexadecimal strings: These represent the unique identifiers (hashes) of Docker layers or images.
   - File sizes (e.g., "3.51MB / 3.51MB", "28.23MB / 28.23MB") corresponding to each layer.
   - Timings (e.g., "1.5s", "2.8s") indicating how long each operation took.
   - Instructions from a Dockerfile, such as "WORKDIR /app", "COPY ./ /app", "COPY requirements.txt /app/", and "RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt".
   - Messages about exporting the image, layers, config, and manifest.
   - A final message naming and unpacking the image to the local Docker repository.

**Middle Section: Docker Container Execution**
The middle part of the image contains a command to run a Docker container:
   - It starts with "docker run".
   - Includes an environment variable setting: "-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN".
   - Specifies port mapping: "-p 8000:8000".
   - Indicates the image to run: "sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586b49"
A file path is also present, which is the directory where the docker command was executed from:
   - "C:\SSNFun\IITM\sudhishssn134-project_1_tds-b240fec>"

**Bottom Section: Application Startup Logs**
The last part of the image contains logs related to the application running inside the Docker container:
   - "INFO: Started server process [1]"
   - "INFO: Waiting for application startup."
   - "INFO: Application startup complete."
   - "INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)"

**Overall Interpretation:**
The image captures a typical development workflow involving Docker:
1.  A Docker image is built from a Dockerfile, which involves layering application code, dependencies, and configuration.
2.  The newly built image is then run as a container.
3.  The application running in the container (likely a web application based on the "Uvicorn" log message) successfully starts up.

In essence, the image showcases a containerization and application deployment scenario.

Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below

Screenshot 2025-04-12 1153421466×702 50.4 KB

Sir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave,

```
uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

```

As I dont have evaluate.py

But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir.  
Please guide me after this sir  
Thank You So much sir
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on the text and key features:

**Overall Impression**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or command-line interface, showing the output of Docker commands and a running application. The text indicates a Docker image build process, followed by the execution of a Docker container, and finally, an application (likely a web service) starting up within that container.

**Docker Image Build Process**

The first section of the image shows the stages of a Docker image build, as indicated by the `=>` symbols and numbered steps within square brackets (e.g., `[2/5]`). Key observations include:

*   **Image Layers:** It builds Docker image layers, showing SHA256 hashes for various components. The `extracting` lines indicate the process of unpacking existing layers.
*   **Context Transfer:** `transferring context: 9.24kB` shows the build context being sent to the Docker daemon.
*   **Dockerfile Commands:** The sequence `WORKDIR /app`, `COPY . /app`, `COPY requirements.txt /app/`, and `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt` suggest a Python application is being containerized. It's copying application files and installing dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file.
*   **Exporting:** After the build steps, there are lines indicating the "exporting" of the image, layers, config, and manifest, along with their SHA256 hashes.
*   **Naming and Unpacking:** The image is named `docker.io/library/sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586b49`, and it's being unpacked to the local Docker repository.

**Docker Container Execution**

The next section shows the command used to run the Docker container. This is a long command, but the key elements are:

*   `docker run`: The standard Docker command to start a container.
*   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`: Sets an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`, which appears to be fetching it from the environment.
*   `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container.
*   `sha256:9739a607cecceea347fade8e485cb7c372b86608284aaa852144ebb755586b49`: Specifies the image (identified by its SHA256 hash) to be used for the container.

**Application Startup**

The final section shows messages indicating the application inside the container is starting:

*   `INFO: Started server process [1]`
*   `INFO: Waiting for application startup.`
*   `INFO: Application startup complete.`
*   `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

This suggests the application is using Uvicorn, an ASGI server, and is listening on port 8000. The message indicates that accessing the application in a browser at `http://0.0.0.0:8000` should work.

**Other details**

* The path to the directory containing the command.
* A link where we can view the build details of the Docker image.

URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 Tools in Data Science

> Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation.
> Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
