Please post any questions related to Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent.

Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM

**Update on 27 Jan 2025**:

A *sample* evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub

You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

Please note:

1. This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
2. Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
3. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:
   * Your code gives correct results *reliably* (i.e. try a few times)
   * Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
4. Your AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
5. For those who submit their code by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

Screenshot 2025-01-23 1516141281×125 18.1 KB

  
sir @Jivraj after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Content:**

The image shows a bullet-point instruction, likely from a tutorial or a set of instructions. The instruction describes setting up and running a Python script.

**Textual Elements:**

*   "A1. Install `uv` (if required) and run" : This is the start of the instruction, suggesting the user may need to install a utility named `uv`.

*   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py` : This is a URL pointing to a Python script named `datagen.py` located on GitHub.

*   "with `${user.email}` as the only argument." : This indicates that when running the script, the user needs to pass their email address (denoted by `${user.email}`) as a command-line argument.

*   "(NOTE: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)" : This is a note clarifying the purpose of running the script: it creates data files that are needed for subsequent steps in the tutorial or task list.

**In summary, the image provides instructions to install a program if needed, download and run a Python script from a specific GitHub URL, and pass a user's email address as an argument to the script. The script's purpose is to generate data files for future tasks.**

Hi Guddu ,

I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?

command that I used :  
`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`

here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

Kind regards  
Jivraj

getting this issue :

```
openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}

```

Hi Aishik,

Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.

23f2005325:

> ```
> openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}
>
> ```

Possible reasons for this issue:

1. Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.
2. Token not being correct.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:** The image is a close-up view of a solid green square with the letter "A" prominently displayed in the center.

**Text:** The letter "A" is the most prominent element. It is white with a soft, slightly blurred or glowing outline.

**Color and Background:** The background is a solid, muted green color. This provides a strong contrast for the white letter, making it easily visible.

**Object:** The only distinct object in the image is the letter "A" itself. 

**Features:** The blur or glow around the letter "A" suggests that it might be a digital graphic or a stylized representation of the letter. The plain background focuses attention on the letter itself.

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest\_number> file? Please clarify.

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  
Deliverables,  
and *an example* of the Evaluation has been provided.  
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.  

Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764×1764 374 KB

Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

Kind regards
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image presents a set of instructions or requirements, likely for a project or assignment. It's divided into sections: "Deliverables," "Note," and "Evaluation."

**Key Sections and Elements:**

1.  **Deliverables:**

    *   The section starts with "Deliverables" in large font, with an arrow pointing from the right side.
    *   A list of tasks related to creating a GitHub repository, writing and testing code, creating a Dockerfile, publishing a Docker image, and running the image using `podman`.
    *   Specific tasks include:
        *   Creating a new GitHub repository.
        *   Adding an MIT LICENSE file.
        *   Writing and testing code using POST and GET requests to `/run?task=...` and `/read?path=...` endpoints, respectively.
        *   Committing and pushing code.
        *   Creating a Dockerfile.
        *   Publishing the Docker image to Docker Hub.
        *   Running the Docker image using `podman`. The command shown is `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, serving the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`.
        *   Submitting the GitHub repository and Docker image URLs via a Google Form. Placeholder URLs are provided in the format `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name` and `user-name/repo-name`.
    *   All these tasks are enclosed within a red border.

2.  **Note:**

    *   This section provides important instructions and limitations related to the AI Proxy.
    *   Highlights the importance of using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable, stressing to avoid committing the AI Proxy token to the repository.  The recommended usage is to set the environment variable before running the script using `os.environ["AIPROXY_TOKEN"]`.
    *   Mentions that the AI Proxy token has a $1 limit.
    *   Specifies that GPT-4o-Mini is the supported generation model for the AI Proxy.
    *   Advises keeping prompts short and concise, ensuring that calls to `/run` and `/read` complete within 20 seconds.

3.  **Evaluation:**
    *   The section contains one word: "Evaluation," in large font, with an arrow pointing from the left side.

**Additional Details:**

*   Code snippets and command-line examples are presented in a monospace font.
*   Emphasis is placed on using environment variables for sensitive information like the AI Proxy token.
*   Rate limiting and supported model information are explicitly mentioned.

In summary, the image provides a set of instructions for developing and deploying an application using AI Proxy, emphasizing security best practices, API usage, and resource limitations.

You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.

Hi Aishik,

Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.

23f2005325:

> ```
> openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}
>
> ```

Possible reasons for this issue:

1. Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.
2. Token not being correct.
Here's a breakdown of the content in the image:

*   **Central Feature:** The image primarily features the capital letter "A". It's rendered in a simple, slightly blurred white font.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid, muted green color. It creates a strong contrast with the white letter, making the "A" stand out.

The overall impression is clean and minimalistic, with the letter "A" as the sole focus.

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest\_number> file? Please clarify.

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  
Deliverables,  
and *an example* of the Evaluation has been provided.  
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.  

Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764×1764 374 KB

Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

Kind regards
Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the text, objects, and relevant features:

**Overall Structure:**

The image appears to be a set of instructions or guidelines for a project, likely related to software development and AI proxy usage. It is divided into sections, notably "Deliverables" and "Evaluation".

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **"Deliverables" Section:** This section, highlighted by a red arrow and a red border, outlines the tasks to be completed.

    *   "Create a new GitHub repository"
    *   "Add an MIT LICENSE file"
    *   "Write and test your code. Call POST /run?task=... with a few tasks and check if GET /read?path=... creates the correct files."
    *   "Commit and push your code"
    *   "Create a Dockerfile that builds your application"
    *   "Publish your Docker image publicly to Docker Hub"
    *   "Ensure that running your image via podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 automatically serves the API at http://localhost:8000/run?task=... and http://localhost:8000/read?path=..." (This line provides a command-line instruction using `podman` to run a Docker image with specific environment variables and port mappings.)
    *   "Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository (https://github.com/user-name/repo-name) and the URL of your Docker image (user-name/repo-name)"

2.  **"Note:" Section:** This section provides important instructions and caveats.

    *   "Use the AIPROXY\_TOKEN environment variable. DON'T commit your AI Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set the AIPROXY\_TOKEN environment variable before running your script. Use os.environ\["AIPROXY\_TOKEN"] as the token in your script." (This emphasizes how to handle the AI Proxy token securely.)
    *   "Use your AI Proxy token. Your AI Proxy token now has a $1 limit. You may use it. If you run out of tokens, ask the TDS team for more. (But try and avoid that.)" (This indicates a token limit for using the AI Proxy.)
    *   "Stick to GPT-4o-Mini. This is the only generation model that AI Proxy currently supports. When this page says "LLM", it means GPT-4o-Mini." (This specifies the AI model to be used.)
    *   "Keep your prompts short and concise. Each call to /run and /read must complete within 20 seconds." (This gives guidance on prompt length and execution time.)

3.  **"Evaluation" Section:** Indicated by a red arrow, this suggests there's a section detailing how the work will be assessed, but the details are not present in the image.

**Key Elements & Inferences:**

*   The project involves working with an AI proxy, likely for interacting with an AI model.
*   Docker is a key component, requiring the creation and deployment of Docker images.
*   Security is emphasized, particularly regarding the handling of the AI Proxy token.
*   There are constraints on the usage of the AI proxy in terms of token limits and prompt length/execution time.
*   GitHub is used for version control and code submission.
*   The API endpoints are `/run` and `/read`.

In summary, the image presents a technical assignment, focusing on AI proxy integration, Docker deployment, and adherence to specific operational constraints.

You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks.

A *sample* evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub

You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

Please note:

1. This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
2. Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
3. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:
   * Your code gives correct results *reliably* (i.e. try a few times)
   * Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
4. Your AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
5. For those who submit their code by Friday, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini - please socialize this during the live sessions.

Hi @Divya1 ,

There won’t be any project1 page such as GA1s, there is a google form(which can be found in same page) which needs to be filled after you do project1.

Hi @23f2005325 ,

Extracting details from credit cards is sensitive, try using strong prompts or take code from LLM and execute it in script.

Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environment using maybe ollama(local llm as now there is deepseek opensource, i doubt we would need to use openai for testing, just for production(test submission) would be enough) and also some agent(langchain, autogen, crewai) just a quick how-to on setting up and problems while setting up if possible

More resources on docker. Using docker as a virtual environment. Editing and executing code in Dockerfiles (like when you change code in src a web framework automatically reloads page(hot reload)), something along the lines of this .

> Regarding Wednenday 9-10 pm live session, maybe the instructors could also discuss how to use docker as a virtual environmen

In Tuesday’s(21 January) session we had discussed docker towards ending of session.  
What was discussed in that live session regarding docker:

1. Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.
2. Pull an existing docker image.
3. Run that image inside a container.
4. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)
5. Once done you can commit it.
6. And push customized container’s image to docker hub.

Regarding local models running for project1, it’s a good idea, we will see if it’s possible to discuss in session.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a close-up crop of an anime character, specifically **Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece**. Only the upper part of his head and shoulders are visible.

**Key Features:**

*   **Character:** Monkey D. Luffy, identifiable by his iconic straw hat and dark, wide eyes.
*   **Straw Hat:** Luffy's distinctive yellow straw hat with a red band is prominently featured.
*   **Pose:** His right arm is raised, with his hand open in what appears to be a wave or greeting gesture.
*   **Background:** The background is a solid, light orange color.

**Overall Impression:**

It appears to be a simple image, potentially a profile picture or avatar. It's cropped in a way that highlights Luffy's iconic hat and a friendly gesture.

Hi @Divya1

Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 8.19.05 am1738×982 122 KB

Please do very carefully all things mentioned in the Deliverables as well as look at the Evaluation Section.  

Screenshot 2025-01-29 at 8.26.08 am1460×496 45.5 KB

We had a session on 28th Jan introducing all the important aspects of Project.

If you do not do everything exactly as mentioned **especially the pre - requisites** mentioned in the Evaluation section you will get 0 in the project and *there will be no appeal* for failing to meet the pre - requisites of the evaluation criteria.

In order for us to evaluate the project you have to provide the deliverables mentioned above.

Kind regards
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image appears to be a slide or a page from a presentation. It's structured as a list of deliverables for a project.

**Text Content:**

*   **Title:** "Deliverables"
*   **List Items:**
    *   "Create a new public GitHub repository."
    *   "Add an MIT LICENSE file"
    *   "Write and test your code. Call `POST /run?task=...` with a few tasks and check if `GET /read?path=...` creates the correct files."
    *   "Commit and push your code"
    *   "Create a Dockerfile that builds your application"
    *   "Publish your Docker image publicly to Docker Hub"
    *   "Ensure that running your image via `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000` automatically serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`"
    *   "Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and your Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`)"

**Objects and Formatting:**

*   **Bullet Points:** Each deliverable starts with a bullet point.
*   **Red Star:** There is a red star graphic next to the title "Deliverables."
*   **Code Snippets:** `POST /run?task=...`, `GET /read?path=...`, `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...`, `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...` are formatted to look like code snippets, possibly using a monospaced font.
*   **Underlined text:** The last point, pertaining to submitting the Google Form, is underlined for emphasis.
*   **Red Box:** The last bullet point, regarding submitting to Google Forms, is enclosed within a red rectangle

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image describes the steps involved in completing and submitting a software project. It requires creating code, containerizing it using Docker, publishing the Docker image, and deploying the application. The final step is to submit the GitHub repository URL and Docker image name via a Google Form. The placeholders `user-name` and `repo-name` indicate where to insert the actual GitHub username and repository name.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a document outlining the scoring criteria for something, likely a project or competition. It focuses on the pre-requisites that a repository must meet to be eligible for evaluation. The text is primarily black against a white background.

Here are the key points extracted from the text:

*   **Title:** "Here's how we will score the results."
*   **Main Heading:** "Pre-requisites:" indicating the criteria that need to be met. The word "MUST" is emphasized, likely to highlight the non-negotiable nature of these requirements.
*   **Criteria for Eligibility:**
    *   The GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
    *   The GitHub repository contains a "LICENSE" file specifically with the MIT license. "LICENSE" is in a highlighted box.
    *   The GitHub repository has a valid "Dockerfile". "Dockerfile" is in a highlighted box.
    *   The Docker image is publicly accessible and can be run using a specific `podman` command: `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`. The command is presented within a grey box, suggesting it is a direct code snippet.
    *   The Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as found in the GitHub repository.

Overall, the image communicates a structured set of requirements for a project involving GitHub repositories, Dockerfiles, and publicly accessible Docker images that run a service on port 8000 using the `podman` command-line tool. The AIPROXY\_TOKEN environment variable is used in the command.

For A6, /data/docs/ has subfolders with .md files from which we have to extract the heading level 1’s (#) right? Apparently there are few files with different content but the same name. Can someone confirm the same? If yes how to address these files @Jivraj @carlton

i updated the libffi package using sudo but while breaking something else can someone pls help me? @carlton @Jivraj @s.anand

history of commands in new codespace

```
    1  crewai --version
    2  pip install crewai crewai-tools
    3  python3 -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
    4  export PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH

    7  crewai create crew <project_name>
    8  crewai create crew b2b
    9  history

```

  
  

UPDATE: IT’s WORKING if you do this in order

```
    1  python3 -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
    2  export PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH
    3  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/conda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    7  exec bash
    8  crewai create crew "Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent"

```

Something about different environment conda and python can the instructors please help me understand it(resources ), so i can trouble shoot this later with better accuracy come precision

Hi @23f1002382,

Yes datagen.py must be present in same directory from where you are executing evaluate.py.

Oh, You trying to use crewai locally for Project1  
kind regards

Hi @JoelJeffrey ,

Filepath is unique for every file, which needs to be inserted to json file.

Post URL: [https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/38](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/38)
---
Ok. So just to confirm, since there are files with the same name, the json file should map the filepath and not the filename to the title right?  

Screenshot from 2025-01-31 12-25-29790×117 19.9 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image shows text resembling a task description or instruction from a programming or data analysis context. It is formatted like a numbered list item.

**Text Content and Key Elements:**

*   **Task Identification:** The task is labeled "A6."
*   **Objective:** The core objective is to:
    *   Find all Markdown files (with the ".md" extension) within the directory `/data/docs/`.
    *   For each Markdown file found, extract the first line that starts with a "#" (which signifies a header in Markdown).
    *   Create a JSON file named `index.json` within the `/data/docs/` directory.
*   **JSON Structure:** The `index.json` file should be a mapping (dictionary) where:
    *   The key is the filename of the Markdown file (without its full path).
    *   The value is the text of the first header line (the line starting with "#") extracted from the file.
*   **Example:** The image includes an example of how the JSON might look:
    `{"README.md": "Home", "large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}`
    This shows that the filename "README.md" is mapped to the title "Home", and "large-language-models.md" is mapped to "Large Language Models".
*   **Constraints:** The key in the JSON object needs to be the filename only without any path information.

In essence, the image describes a task to automate the creation of an index that associates Markdown filenames with their corresponding header titles, storing this information in a structured JSON file.

result after running evaluate.py:

Score: 0 / 10

why sir @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini what is the problem here??  
please do a live session of complete project process with one or two tasks if possible
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Content:**

The image shows a dartboard with a dart stuck in the bullseye. This represents accuracy, achievement, or hitting a target.

**Specific Elements:**

*   **Dartboard:** The dartboard has the classic red and white circular pattern, with concentric rings leading to the central bullseye.
*   **Dart:** A blue dart is lodged directly in the bullseye, indicating a perfect shot.
*   **Shadow:** A subtle shadow appears beneath the dart, adding a touch of depth to the image.

**Possible Interpretations:**

The image signifies success, precision, goal achievement, or a successful outcome. It could be used to represent a target met, a strategic plan executed well, or a goal realized.

Hi Guddu,

We are planning several project sessions in order to show the workflow of creating a successful project.

Although you are returning a 200 ok, the get request file must match the expectation. In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.

In this case you would write out the the `expected` variable in the `evaluate.py` and see if `result` variable matches the `expected`. Then you can figure out what went wrong.

Kind regards

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:** The image features a yellow circular emoji.

**Features:**

*   **Emoji Design:** The emoji has a simple, cartoonish face. It has two round, brown eyes and a small, slightly curved mouth indicating a neutral or subtle smiling expression.
*   **Hand Gesture:** A stylized, light-yellow hand is positioned near the forehead, making a gesture that could be interpreted as a salute, a facepalm, or pushing hair back. The exact meaning depends on the context of the message it's used in.
*   **Color:** The face is a bright yellow color, a standard color for many emojis to represent human skin. The hand is a lighter shade of yellow.
*   **Background:** The background is solid black, making the emoji stand out.

**Potential Interpretations:**

*   Depending on the context, this emoji could mean:
    *   Salute (formal or informal greeting/respect)
    *   Facepalm (expression of frustration, embarrassment, or disbelief)
    *   A gesture of thinking or pondering
    *   Dismissal or disbelief (similar to saying "yeah, right")
    *   An acknowledgment or recognition

The specific meaning is often determined by how the emoji is used in a message or conversation.

the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic “ls” command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.  
Do you think we could access a better model?

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?  
because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.  
So if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.  
I spent a week on this just saying

sent pull request maybe accept it then please
Okay, I can describe the content of the image.

The image shows a single emoji. It is a yellow circle, representing a face. The face is upside down. It has two small, round eyes, and a curved line that represents a mouth but is also inverted. This is the "Upside-Down Face" emoji.

can we have the code for this session please?  
@Jivraj @carlton
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image is a stylized illustration with a focus on data science tools. The main area of the image features a collection of icons and graphics associated with data science, set against a cream-colored background. There is a dark blue rectangle, which appears like a screen in the center. Inside this rectangle are the words "TOOLS IN DATA SCIENCE" written in large, blocky orange letters. Above and below this central screen, there are various data-related icons.

Above the rectangle, there are icons that appear to represent data visualization, such as pie charts, bar graphs, and connected data points. There are also icons that seem to represent data analysis tools, like microscopes and magnifying glasses.

Below the rectangle, there are more icons. These include various types of graphs (e.g., line graphs, pie charts), data networks, and what may be tools for cutting or slicing data, like scissors.

Overall, the image presents a visually appealing and thematic representation of data science tools, highlighting the different aspects and processes involved in this field. The color scheme is consistent and well-balanced, with a mix of bright and muted tones, giving the image a modern and informative look.

Hello, I recently started working on the project. I understood how to do all the phase A tasks on a high level but I’m struggling to start the implementation of the first task in phase A. I’m confused mainly about how the /data directory is supposed to be created, I don’t know how to generate the data and a little confused about the output formats. I would appreciate if I could get in contact with anyone who could guide me in the right direction.

Hello everyone, @s.anand @carlton  
I had a few queries regarding the project;

1. I am preloading my docker image with uv and generating the /data files when the container is ran. For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?
2. For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”?
3. Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?
4. For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”

For Project-1 to complete, it requires:  
"You MUST complete ALL these 3 steps to get a score. Failure to do so will result in getting 0 in the project. If you do not do ALL these 3 steps before the deadline, there will be no appeal available.  
• Fill the form that is on the Project Page  
But I did not get the form; where is it? While I checked inside the project pages also.

Hi Dewang,

Screenshot 2025-02-03 at 6.27.39 pm 12268×1766 491 KB

Please *read* the Project page Deliverables carefully as well as the Evaluation Pre - Requisites.

Kind regards
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a document or webpage, likely a tutorial or guide related to "Tools in Data Science." It is split into two main sections:

*   **Left Sidebar:**  A navigation menu with headings like "Tools in Data Science," "Development Tools," "Deployment Tools," "Large Language Models," "Project 1," "Data Sourcing," "Data Preparation," "Data Analysis," "Data Visualization," and "Live Sessions." Some of these headings are expanded, revealing sub-items. Specifically, under "Project 1," there are items such as "Background," "Create an API," "Phase A: Handle Operatio...", "Phase B: Handle Business ...", "Deliverables," and "Evaluation."
*   **Main Content Area:** This section focuses on a list of deliverables or instructions.

**Key Content & Instructions:**

The main content area lists several steps, including:

*   Creating a new public GitHub repository
*   Adding an MIT LICENSE file
*   Writing and testing code, including calling `POST /run?task=...` and `GET /read?path=...`
*   Committing and pushing code
*   Creating a Dockerfile
*   Publishing a Docker image publicly to Docker Hub
*   Ensuring the image runs with a specific command using `podman` and AI Proxy Token:
    `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=SAIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`
*   It mentions the API being served at specific localhost addresses.
*   **Crucially:** The instructions include the phrase: "Submit in this Google Form the URL of your GitHub repository" followed by the link `(https://github.com/user-name/repo-name)` within parentheses, and a prompt for the Docker image name.

**Notes and Best Practices:**

*   **AI Proxy Token:** The document stresses the importance of using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable and *not* committing the token to the repository.
*   **AI Proxy Token Limit:** It mentions a $1 limit for the Al Proxy token and advises users to contact the TDS team for more tokens if needed.
*   **LLM Model:** It specifies using the `GPT-4o-Mini` model.
*   **Prompt Length:** The guide emphasizes keeping prompts short and concise.

**Other Noteworthy Elements:**

*   The word "Deliverables" is the heading of the current section.
*   The word "Evaluation" appears at the end of the text.

**Overall Impression:**

This image presents a technical document outlining the steps required for a project, likely involving code, a GitHub repository, Docker containers, and an AI Proxy. It highlights the importance of security, proper environment variable usage, and efficient prompt design.

@s.anand sir, I see that the project 1 timeline was changed from February 7 - 17, 2025 to January 17 - February 15 which undoubtedly is a good increase in duration. However, I have my GATE DA exam on Feb 15 and the exam center is unexpectedly far. So, I request you to consider pushing the deadline to at least Feb 16. If not, I’ll still do my best.

Hello! @carlton @s.anand

Is the proxy server down right now?  
I am getting this error when I am accessing the endpoint:

Or, do I have to install crypto module?

@21f3002390 - AI Proxy is working and you *did* get the result. You can ignore any `costError`. It won’t happen in the future anyway.

**What’s happening?** I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, `crypto.createHash` is not supported in CloudFlare. I fixed that by removing this. I’ll introduce caching later if required.

For the question #A8 on recognizing the credit card number in the image, Open AI doesn’t seem to be recognizing the number correctly and as a result the evaluation is failing. What should be the solution?  

image913×498 13.6 KB
The image shows a log of a task being executed. The task involves passing an image containing a credit card number to an LLM, extracting the number, and writing it to a file without spaces.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Task Description:** The initial text describes the overall goal: to extract a credit card number from the image `/data/credit_card.png` and save it without spaces to the file `/data/credit-card.txt`.

*   **HTTP Request (POST):**  A POST request is made to `http://localhost:8000/run` with a URL-encoded task description. The task instructs the server to process `/data/credit_card.png`, which contains a credit card number, and to write the extracted number without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt`.

*   **HTTP Response (200 OK):** The server responds with a 200 OK, indicating success. The response includes a JSON payload specifying the function to be executed ("extract\_numbers\_from\_image") and the input and output file paths.

*   **HTTP Request (GET):** A GET request is made to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/credit-card.txt` to retrieve the contents of the output file.

*   **File Content:** The retrieved content of `/data/credit-card.txt` is shown.

*   **Expected vs. Result:**
    *   **EXPECTED:**  The expected credit card number is "4026399336539356".
    *   **RESULT:** The actual extracted credit card number is "402639933635936".

*   **Difference:** The extracted result differs from the expected result.  The 10th digit is incorrect in the result, the 5 should be an s.

A query regarding the task description in the query given to LLM for phase A.

For task A3, we have been asked to count wednesdays and the python file corresponding to A3 does count for wednesday alone. However the example says the LLM might be asked to count Sundays or other days. Should we be modifying task A3 code? Or was that just an example and only Wednesdays would need to be counted?

Tasks in Phase A are defined but that does not mean it has to do one precise thing. If that was the case then there is no use for an LLM.

Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal.

The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks.

We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday.

Kind regards

how to handle this error  

image1425×490 11.1 KB

  
@carlton @s.anand
The image shows a terminal session in a Linux environment. The user, "Vikash", is in the directory `/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM_Project`.

The user executed a command:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=$AIPROXY_TOKEN uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanando/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/evaluate.py
```
This command appears to be running a Python script located at the provided URL using the `uv run` command, with the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set.

The script execution resulted in a `ModuleNotFoundError`. Specifically, the error message states: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datagen'`.  This indicates that the Python script `/tmp/evaluatewEpC39.py` attempts to import a module named "datagen", but this module is not found in the Python environment where the script is being executed. The error occurs on line 20 of the script where it states `from datagen import`. The ellipsis (...<9 lines>...) suggests that the full import statement is longer than just the 'datagen' part.

If it is expecting str then why throw error sir ? @carlton @Jivraj  
or just tell me how to pass count as an int here

```
with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(str(count)) 

```
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   **Object:** The image features a single red, spherical object.
*   **Shape & Color:** The object is circular with a solid red color. There are variations in the shading suggesting the shape is round and glossy.
*   **Background:** The object is set against a plain black background, which makes the red circle stand out.
*   **Pixelation:** The pixelated nature of the image is evident. This suggests the image may be small in size or significantly zoomed in.
*   **Details:** There is a small, lighter red spot on the upper left side, which hints to it being shiny.
 Okay, here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image depicts a yellow warning sign or triangle with a black exclamation point inside.

**Breakdown:**

*   **Shape:** The sign is a triangular shape, a standard design convention for hazard and warning signs.

*   **Color:** The color of the triangle is yellow. Yellow is often used to signal caution or potential danger.

*   **Symbol:** Inside the triangle, there is a large, bold, black exclamation point (!). The exclamation point is a common symbol used to denote a warning, alert, or to emphasize importance.

*   **Overall Impression:** The image is simple and straightforward. It immediately conveys a sense of caution or potential danger.
 Okay, here's a detailed description of the image:

The image contains a yellow warning sign in the shape of an equilateral triangle. Inside the triangle, there is a large, black exclamation mark (!).  The triangle has a slightly glossy, almost cartoonish, appearance. The background is black, which makes the yellow of the triangle and the black of the exclamation mark stand out prominently.

**Key elements:**

*   **Shape:** Equilateral triangle.
*   **Color:** Yellow (triangle) and black (exclamation mark).
*   **Symbol:** Exclamation mark.
*   **Context:** Warning sign.
*   **Background:** Black.

This image strongly suggests a warning or alert about a potential hazard or issue. The exclamation mark is a universal symbol for attention and caution.

@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj  
**I am getting below error message from LLM end points **https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions or https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings** , while running my project .**

Kindly help me to resolve this issue.
The image shows an error message in a JSON format. The message indicates an "API Error: 429", which usually represents a rate limiting or exceeding usage limits. Within the message field, it specifies that "On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2".  This suggests a financial transaction or limit was exceeded in February 2025.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a digital emoji. It's a yellow face with a sad expression. Here's a breakdown of the details:

*   **Face Color:** The face is a standard yellow color, which is typical for many emojis.
*   **Expression:** The face has a downturned mouth, suggesting sadness. The eyebrows are also arched upward in a way that indicates concern or unhappiness.
*   **Tear:** A single, bright blue tear is dripping down the left side of the face. The tear is clearly visible and emphasizes the sadness of the emoji.

In summary, the image is of a classic sad face emoji featuring a single tear. It's commonly used to convey feelings of sadness, disappointment, or sympathy.

@carlton Will there be evaluation script for tasks in group B also?

Some questions about ‘B’ group tasks:

Q1: For the following tasks (B5, B7, B9, and B10) tasks, how will input files be provided? Will it be URL or will `datagen.py` also generate files for these?

Q2: For the above tasks as well as for B6 ( Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website), how should output be returned?

Q3: In task B8, for transcribing audio file, which Python package is recommended or do we need to use OpenAI API?

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
B7. Compress or resize an image  
B8. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file  
B9. Convert Markdown to HTML  
B10. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

its expecting to match every single detail in that even " and ’ .  
in that case changing evaluate.py will result in zero or less marks.  
llm will only handle -calling function based on query and parameter . What is it going to do about the logic of functions.

If i still focus on passing evaluate.py will it be any good sir @carlton @s.anand

Sorry, sir, not trying to be rude, but there isn’t a single full-fledged project session. It’s a bit difficult to dive into the project without guidance on how to do it. It would be nice to have a full project session where we can start a project from the beginning and follow it to completion.

We will be doing project session on ~~Tuesday 9 Feb~~ [correction] Tuesday 11th of Feb (thanks @23f1002382 @23f2000237) . Project 1 uses the things you learnt in week 1-3. But mostly week 2 & 3.

We dont do it in the beginning, (but introduced it 2 weeks ago in a live session), to give students chance to practise the new learnings from week 2 & 3.

The plan has always been to demonstrate a few tasks and have you try doing the rest.

Kind regards

The image displays an error message in JSON format. Here's a breakdown of the content:

*   **JSON Structure:** The message is a dictionary (or object in JSON terminology) containing an 'error' key.
*   **Error Type:** The 'error' value is a string indicating "API Error: 429". The 429 HTTP status code commonly signifies "Too Many Requests", suggesting rate limiting is in effect.
*   **Detailed Message:** Nested within the main error message is a "message" field that gives a more specific explanation: "On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2". This implies a usage limit was exceeded, with the user going slightly over the $2 limit.
*   **Formatting Characters:** There are newline characters ("\n") present in the message. These would typically create line breaks if the message were properly rendered or displayed.
* The date the error occurred was in February of 2025.
* The amount that was exceeded was two dollars and two ten million trillionths, and that exceeded the two dollar limit.

> **Update: 27 Feb 2025**:

Sir, does this mean 27th is submission deadline?
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a close-up shot of a man's face against a blurred, warm-toned background. The lighting appears to be soft and potentially artificial, creating a slightly dramatic effect.

**Details:**

*   **Subject:** The main subject is a man with light skin and dark hair. He appears to be middle-aged.
*   **Facial Features:**
    *   He has a prominent brow and cheekbones.
    *   He seems to be wearing glasses with a thin frame.
    *   His gaze is directed slightly upward and to his left.
    *   His expression is somewhat serious or thoughtful.
*   **Clothing:** He seems to be wearing a collared shirt or jacket, but only the collar is clearly visible. It's a light color, possibly grey or beige.
*   **Background:** The background is blurred and out of focus. The colors are warm, suggesting a brown or reddish tone. This lack of detail keeps the focus on the man's face.
*   **Color Palette:** The image features a warm color palette, with browns, reddish hues, and subtle highlights.

**In summary, this image portrays a portrait of a man, likely in a professional or formal setting. The focus is on his face and expression, hinting at an intellectual or introspective personality.**

Hi Aindree,

No its a typo (and will be corrected soon). In the context of what was written it clearly means it was *updated* on 27th January. The update being that the evaluation.py file was provided so that you could test your code against it.

Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

Hi

This would be only for a selected few questions right because say for the credit card question, where the LLM is involved, to get the card number itself, we have to give a fine-tuned and strong query.

I have done the a1 to a10 task and tried querying through localhost and its working fine basically all these ten steps but dont know whether its enough or not. also steps in phase B i am confused that should we create separate endpoints for these tasks or should it be with same /run endpoint and query. then will the input be random by any user. what about the output . where should it be given. phase b needs more explanation.

Hi @carlton @Jivraj  
Facing some issues in running my project. Taking an example of the Phase A - A3 task.

I am able to read my files through the GET/read/data/dates.txt query.  
I am also able to use the count\_wednesdays function through the POST/run task/count\_wednesdays.

But when I am entering a query such as “count\_wednesdays in data/dates.txt” I am unable to get a response.  

image618×246 6.28 KB

  
Please advice. Thank you.
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image appears to be a section of a documentation page or API reference. It's structured in a tabular format, with "Code" and "Details" as column headers.  The background color is a light greenish-blue.

**Content Details:**

*   **Code:** The code is "200", which is a standard HTTP status code indicating success, despite the content of the response body.
*   **Details:** Under the "Details" column, there's the label "Response body". Below this label, there's a dark gray box containing JSON formatted text.

**JSON Content:**

The JSON within the gray box is:

```json
{
  "error": "Could not understand the task"
}
```

This JSON indicates that, although the request was successful (status code 200), the server encountered an error processing the task. The error message states it "Could not understand the task".

**In Summary:** The image describes a situation where a server responds with a 200 OK status code, but the response body contains an error message indicating that the server was unable to understand the task it was asked to perform. This might occur when a request is syntactically correct but contains invalid or nonsensical parameters.

On task A8, credit-card.png is given, but it is in credit\_card.  
it makes the errors. I checked that 2 to 3 tasks depend on these, and we create the ouput file with ‘-’ this only. please clarify that output and input files name ‘-’ or ‘\_’ @carlton @Jivraj
The image shows two instructions related to extracting information from files.

The first instruction says to extract the email address from the sender and write the email address to the file "/data/email-sender.txt".

The second instruction, labeled "A8", states that the file "/data/credit-card.png" contains a credit card number. It directs the user to pass the image to a Large Language Model (LLM), have the LLM extract the credit card number, and write the extracted number (without spaces) to the file "/data/credit-card.txt".

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a target with a dart stuck in the center. The target consists of concentric red and white circles radiating outwards from the center. A blue dart is lodged directly in the bullseye (the central circle). The dart casts a slight shadow on the target.

**Key Features:**

*   **Target:** Red and white concentric circles. Bullseye at the center.
*   **Dart:** Blue, pointed at the target's center.
*   **Shadow:** A subtle shadow cast by the dart.

**Interpretation:**

The image clearly represents accuracy, precision, achieving a goal, or hitting a target. The dart perfectly positioned in the bullseye emphasizes success and directness.

Hi Andrew,

You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.

I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.

**In other words getting 10/10 in `evaluate.py` does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation.**

So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.

That said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).

Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)

**A word of caution:** *(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)* Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (*possibly your first task*) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

Kind regards

Respected @s.anand @carlton and @Jivraj ,

Is anyone actively monitoring the Discourse page? I have been raising this issue for the past few days, but there has been no response. Does this mean the TAs are not addressing students’ concerns?

I am encountering the following error while running my project with these LLM endpoints:

* **https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions**
* **https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings**  
    
  This issue is blocking my progress, and I urgently need assistance to resolve it. Kindly provide guidance or suggest a solution at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks,  
Telvin Varghese
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall:**

The image displays a block of text, seemingly code or a data output, presented in a monospaced font. The text is displayed against a dark gray or black background. The text represents an error message in a format often seen in programming or API responses (likely JSON).

**Textual content:**

The text content of the image is as follows:

```
{'error': 'API Error: 429, {\n "message": "On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"\n}'}
```

**Interpretation of the text:**

*   **{'error': 'API Error: 429,...'}**: This indicates that the data represents an error. `API Error: 429` signifies a specific type of API error, where 429 typically stands for "Too Many Requests" or "Rate Limited". This means the system received too many requests in a given timeframe.
*   **{\n "message": "..."\n}**:  This part encapsulates the error message. The `\n` suggests a newline character, though in this display it simply appears as a literal "\n".
*   **"On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2"**: This is the specific message elaborating on the rate limiting issue. It states that in February 2025, a certain usage ($2.002295600000011) exceeded a limit of $2.

Hi,  
I am not able to understand how to do the Project 1. The date is also very near.

The problem I am facing is, When I did the Modules the page was different, but now in the Project 1 I am not getting any section to submit the project.

Please let me know where are the questions and how tot submit that.  
The deadline is near.

> o do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of `evaluate.py`. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.

This where I need help, i tried doing with agentic framework but i failed with the model in llm proxy, which was highly suspect because, that model should have known what the uv framework but it seemed to me to be outdated. Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before

Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.

I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a headshot of a man against a solid, light-colored background.

**Person:**

*   **Gender:** Male
*   **Apparent Ethnicity:** Appears to be of South Asian descent.
*   **Age:** Appears to be in his late 20s to mid-30s.
*   **Attire:** He is wearing a purple collared shirt.
*   **Facial Features:** He has short dark hair neatly styled, and he wears glasses with dark frames. He has a warm smile.

**Background:**

*   The background is a plain, light yellow color. There are no distinct patterns or objects visible in the background, making the person the main focus.

**Overall:**

Hi Telvin

You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.

Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm2078×1276 305 KB

In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50

As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ *(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)* for us!

The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.

In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.

Kind regards
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image is a screenshot of a webpage related to "Large Language Models" on a website called "Tools in Data Science". It shows the main content of the page and a sidebar navigation menu.

**Left Sidebar (Navigation Menu):**

*   "Tools in Data Science" heading in red.
*   A search bar with the placeholder text "Type to search".
*   An expandable/collapsible list of categories:
    *   "Tools in Data Science" (closed)
    *   "Development Tools" (expanded)
    *   "Deployment Tools" (expanded)
    *   "Large Language Models" (expanded - and selected, indicated by red color and a vertical red bar)
        *   "Prompt engineering"
        *   "TDS TA Instructions"
        *   "TDS GPT Reviewer"
        *   "LLM Sentiment Analysis"
        *   "LLM Text Extraction"
        *   "Base 64 Encoding"
        *   "Vision Models"
        *   "Embeddings"
        *   "Topic modeling"

**Main Content Area:**

*   **Title:** "Large Language Models"
*   **Introductory Text:** "This module covers the practical usage of large language models (LLMs) - a relatively a new area."
*   **Cost and Usage Limitations:** "LLMs incur a cost. We have created API keys for everyone with an [iitm.ac.in](<http://iitm.ac.in>) email to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`. Your usage is limited to $1 per calendar month for this course. Don't exceed that." (The sentence about usage limit is emphasized by a red box.)
*   **Instructions on using AI Proxy:** "Use AI Proxy instead of OpenAl. Specifically:"
    *   "1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`"
    *   "2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` that someone will give you."
*   **Navigation Links:**
    *   "< Previous" - "Local LLMs: Llamafile"
    *   "Next >" - "Prompt engineering"

**Other Features:**

*   Browser tabs at the top of the screen shows the URL: tds.s-anand.net/#/large-language-models
*   A Chrome profile picture can be seen in the top right corner.

**Key Takeaways:**

The page provides information about using large language models, specifically emphasizing a cost limitation and instructions on using an AI proxy for OpenAI. It seems targeted at users affiliated with iitm.ac.in.

Every request you send, gives you a response back with exactly how much that request cost. So you can track your usage.

I’m aware of that. I’ve mostly noticed a cost of $0.0003 per request, so I haven’t been tracking my total monthly expenses. Moving forward, I’ll keep a record of the cost for each request. Also, do strong prompts impact the overall cost?

Screenshot 2025-02-11 1814531459×207 15.3 KB

  
Could you kindly help me with this
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image shows a screenshot of a terminal or command-line interface. It captures an error message that occurred while running a Python script using a tool called "uv".

**Text Breakdown:**

1.  **Command Prompt:**
    *   `abhro014@Abhro:/mnt/d/My_folder/IITM online degree/Diploma/TDS/Project1$`
        *   This indicates the current user (`abhro014`), the machine (`Abhro`), and the current directory (`/mnt/d/My_folder/IITM online degree/Diploma/TDS/Project1`). The `$` suggests it's a normal user (not a root user).

2.  **Command Executed:**
    *   `uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py 23f1002104@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
        *   This line shows the command that was executed. `uv run` means it's running a script. The script is being fetched from a URL on GitHub:
            *   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py` (likely a data generation script).
        *   It also seems to be passing a student id: `23f1002104@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`.

3.  **Informational Message:**
    *   `Reading inline script metadata from remote URL`
        *   This is a message indicating that the "uv" tool is retrieving metadata from the script at the given URL.

4.  **Error Message (Traceback):**
    *   `Traceback (most recent call last):`
    *   `File "/tmp/datagen2eQ208.py", line 284, in <module>`
        *   The script (`datagen2eQ208.py`) has an error on line 284 in a module context. The file is likely a temporary copy of the script fetched from the URL.
    *   `os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)`
        *   The error occurred during the execution of the `os.makedirs` function.  This function is used to create directories recursively. The `config["root"]` part indicates that the path to create is coming from a configuration dictionary under the key "root". The `exist_ok=True` argument means that it shouldn't raise an error if the directory already exists.
    *   `File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs`
        *   The error is within the `makedirs` function of the Python standard library `os` module.
    *   `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/data'`
        *   **The key error:** The script is being denied permission to create the directory `/data`. This suggests that the user running the script does not have write access to that location.

**Key Observations & Potential Issues:**

*   **Permission Problem:** The most important information is the `PermissionError`. The script needs to create a directory at `/data`, but the user running it lacks the necessary permissions.
*   **GitHub Script:**  The script is being fetched from a public GitHub repository, which is related to an "IITM" (Indian Institute of Technology Madras) data science course.
*   **Temporary File:** The traceback indicates that the script is run from a temporary location (`/tmp/`).
*   **Configuration:** The destination directory `/data` appears to be coming from a config file setting under the key `"root"`.

In summary, the image shows an error resulting from a Python script, fetched from a remote URL, attempting to create a directory for which the user lacks the proper permissions.

Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Structure:**

The image shows a code snippet or tutorial on creating and querying a vector embedding database. It's broken down into two steps:

*   **Step 1 (Implied):** Storing Documents in the Database (The code for this is present in the top portion of the image).
*   **Step 2:** Retrieving Information from the Database. This step is explicitly labeled and described.

**Code Snippets:**

*   **Storing Documents:**

    ```python
    # store each document in a vector embedding database
    for i, d in enumerate(documents):
        response = ollama.embed(model="mxbai-embed-large", input=d)
        embeddings = response["embeddings"]
        collection.add(
            ids=[str(i)],
            embeddings=embeddings,
            documents=[d]
        )
    ```

    *   This code iterates through a list of "documents."
    *   For each document, it generates an embedding using `ollama.embed` and the "mxbai-embed-large" model.
    *   The embeddings, along with the document IDs and original documents, are added to a `collection` object (presumably representing the vector database).
*   **Retrieving Information:**

    ```python
    # an example input
    input = "What animals are llamas related to?"
    
    # generate an embedding for the input and retrieve the most relevant doc
    response = ollama.embed(
        model="mxbai-embed-large",
        input=prompt
    )
    
    results = collection.query(
        query_embeddings=[response["embedding"]],
        n_results=1
    )
    
    data = results['documents'][0][0]
    ```

    *   An example input prompt is defined: "What animals are llamas related to?"
    *   The code then generates an embedding for the input prompt using `ollama.embed` and the same model as before.
    *   It queries the `collection` with the generated embedding, asking for the top 1 result (`n_results=1`).
    *   The retrieved document is then extracted from the `results` object.

**Key Elements and Features:**

*   **Ollama:** The code uses the `ollama` library, suggesting this is related to an Ollama-based embedding system.
*   **Embedding Model:** The "mxbai-embed-large" model is used for both storing and querying data. This is important for consistency.
*   **Vector Database:** The concept of a vector database is central, where documents are represented by numerical embeddings.
*   **Querying:** The example shows how to generate an embedding for a search query and find the most similar document in the database.
*   **Example Prompt:** The included example prompt is "What animals are llamas related to?". This serves to demonstrate the retrieval process.

In essence, the image presents a minimal example of how to create a vector embedding database with Ollama, store documents as embeddings, and query it to retrieve relevant information based on an input prompt.

TDS project  Tedious project
Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image features a red "X" mark. It appears to be a digital representation, likely an emoji or a graphic.

**Key features:**

*   **Shape:** The primary shape is an "X," formed by two diagonally intersecting lines.
*   **Color:** The "X" is rendered in a shade of red.
*   **Style:** The design appears somewhat stylized, potentially with rounded edges and a slight glossy or reflective appearance (due to the lighter edges), suggesting it's not a simple flat shape.
*   **Background:** The "X" is set against a black background, which helps it stand out.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image contains a green square with rounded corners. Inside the square, there is a white checkmark (tick). The green color is a muted shade, and there's a slight gradient effect, suggesting a glossy or somewhat three-dimensional appearance. The checkmark is simple and cleanly drawn.

**Interpretation:**

The image is a common representation of:

*   Confirmation
*   Approval
*   Success
*   A completed task
*   "Yes"
*   A checkbox that has been selected.

Its updated in the TDS live sessions playlist
Here is a description of the image:

The image features a colorful, geometric design with the text "Week 5 Session 1" superimposed on it in large, white letters. The design appears to be a stylized representation of data, technology, and analytical tools, including elements like charts, graphs, a world globe, circuit diagrams, a computer screen, pencils, and measuring instruments. The color palette is rich and includes shades of blue, teal, orange, red, and yellow. The overall composition suggests a theme related to learning, data analysis, or technology training, potentially for a specific week and session within a course. A navy blue rectangle partially obscures the image, framing the text.

*For task A2*:

* **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place

I am getting the following error:  
`🔴 A2 failed: Command '['npx', 'prettier@3.4.2', '--stdin-filepath', '/data/format.md']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`

However, running a **POST request** to https://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2 gives successful output.

`{"success":true,"message":"Formatted and verified successfully!"}%`

Here is my code snippet:

```
def format_file(filepath):
    while True:  # Loop until formatting and verification pass
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(
                ["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", filepath],
                check=False,  # Don't raise exception automatically
                capture_output=True,
                text=True
            )

            if result.returncode != 0:
                return {"success": False, "message": f"Prettier write failed: {result.stderr}"}

            if verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
                return {"success": True, "message": "Formatted and verified successfully!"}
            else:
                logging.info("Verification failed. Retrying formatting...") #Log the retry
                # If verification fails, the loop continues and prettier --write is executed again.

        except Exception as e:
            return {"success": False, "message": str(e)}

def verify_prettier_formatting(filepath):
    try:
        subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--check", filepath], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True) #Capture output
        return True  # File is formatted correctly
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Prettier check failed: {e.stderr}") # Log the error from prettier check
        return False  # File is not formatted correctly

```

What am I missing here?

Has anyone succeeded in the extraction of credit cards details task? The LLM seems to consider it as illegal task and if I use pytessaract the docker image size will become really large. What to do in this case?

Hi @carlton @Jivraj,

I followed what you taught in Feb 11 session and tried implementing task A1. My understanding is once i run the subprocess, datagen.py file should be run and /data folder should be created in the project folder. But it is not happening to me. I am getting the following error

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/folders/rj/z_3b8hl51558519w90k5hp600000gn/T/datagen4COEF3.py", line 284, in <module>
    os.makedirs(config["root"], exist_ok=True)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "<frozen os>", line 227, in makedirs
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/data'

```

If i can’t automate this process, i don’t see the point writing code for other tasks. Can anyone help me solving this error?

If I am not wrong, both the expected and actual result contain the same entries. It is just that the ordering is different. The expected result also doesnt follow any particular format (so does the actual result).

Kindly advise on this @carlton

**EDIT** : Resolved on a later evaluation

For the task - \* **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data

Do we have to handle prompts for converting CSV to JSON or for writing an endpoint for doing so?

Dear Instructors (@carlton, @iamprasna):

Confirming, just to be needfully pedantic:

It will **solely** be the responsibility of the Project Evaluator (human or machine) to parse the correct `AIPROXY_TOKEN` generated against my IITM email ID (presumably, per some database which holds all such generated `AIPROXY_TOKEN`s of the students who have generated one); and the correct `$IMAGE_NAME` (to-be-submitted by myself in the Project Submission Google Form) in `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`, correct?

Asking this seemingly obvious question, as (apparently) the actual `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is not to be included anywhere in the code, or the repository, or the dockerfile.

I am also facing the same issue, just that the ordering is different.  
Sorting by keys also didn’t help.

sir will the tasks of Phase A and Phase B change? like currently do we need to make llm write the code for all tasks dynamically or can we write a pre defined python code to execute tasks after the llm parses the task and runs python code

That error is usually if you are using the wrong endpoint (ie. using open ai libraries instead of sending requests to aiproxy).

Without seeing the request its hard to tell you what the cause of the error is.

Kind regards

hi @carlton @Jivraj  
for A2 i am getting this particular error and i don’t know what i am doing wrong in this  

Screenshot from 2025-02-12 19-31-471501×564 44.7 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Context:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or code editor, likely showing the output of a script or program that's using the "prettier" code formatter. It details a task where "prettier" is used to format a Markdown file (`/data/format.md`) in place. The image includes HTTP requests and responses related to this formatting process.

**Key Text and Components:**

1.  **Task Description:**
    *   "Running task: Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place"
    *   This sets the context. It's a task to format the specified Markdown file using a specific version of "prettier."

2.  **HTTP Requests and Responses:**
    *   **POST Request:**  `HTTP Request: POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=... "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"` This suggests the formatting is triggered by sending a POST request to a local server.  The long string in the URL after `task=` is URL-encoded data, likely containing instructions about which file to format and which version of prettier to use.
        *   The HTTP status code "200 OK" indicates the request was successful.
    *   **JSON Response:** The JSON data returned in the POST request, and indented below "HTTP 200," shows information about the executed function.
        *   `"function": "format_file_with_prettier"`: The server processed the request as a "format\_file\_with\_prettier" function
        *   `"arguments": { "file_path": "/data/format.md", "prettier_version": "3.4.2" }`: The arguments passed to the function include the target file path and prettier version.
    *   **GET Request:**  `HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"` This GET request is likely made to read the contents of `/data/format.md` to verify that the changes were made.  The status code "200 OK" suggests the file was successfully retrieved.

3.  **File Content and "Expected" vs. "Result":**
    *   It seems the output is showing a diff or comparison, highlighting the differences between what was *expected* and the *result* found in the file.
    *   `/data/format.md` with a red circle implies something is not working as expected here.
    *   **"▲ RESULT: #Unformatted Markdown"**:  Indicates the file was found to be unformatted.
    *   The subsequent text shows the content of the file:
        *   A paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.
        *   A list:
            *   First item
            *   Second item
            *   +Third item
            *   Fourth item
        *   A python code snippet: `print("user@example.com")`

**Interpretation:**

The image shows a process of attempting to format a Markdown file using "prettier." It appears that the file was successfully read and formatted. The initial state was "Unformatted Markdown", including trailing whitespaces and inconsistent list formatting, and the final state is not shown, which suggests the formatting was not performed by `prettier` successfully.

you mean screenshot of evaluate.py file?  

Screenshot from 2025-02-12 20-21-561501×564 61.8 KB
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:**

*   The image is a screenshot of a code editor, likely VS Code, showing Python code.
*   The code appears to be related to formatting Markdown files, potentially using a tool like "prettier".

**Code Snippets:**

*   **Line 77:** `return email in await read("/data/format.md")` This line likely reads the content of a Markdown file located at `/data/format.md` and checks if the email is present in that content.

*   **Lines 79-98 (Function `a2`):**

    *   `async def a2(email: str, file: str = "/data/format.md", **kwargs):`  Defines an asynchronous function named `a2` that takes an email (string) and a file path (string, defaulting to "/data/format.md") as input.
    *   `original = get_markdown(email)`: Gets the Markdown content associated with the email. The function `get_markdown` is assumed to be defined elsewhere.
    *   `expected = subprocess.run(...)`: This section runs a subprocess using `subprocess.run`. The command is likely using `npx` to run a specific version of `prettier` (version 3.4.2) on the input file. The arguments passed to `prettier` include `--stdin-filepath` which specifies the filepath to the file being formatted, with `file` referencing the `file` parameter passed to the function `a2`. The `input` is set to `original` which is the markdown content associated with the email. Various flags are being passed to `subprocess.run` such as `capture_output=True` and `text=True`.  `shell=True` is set to handle Windows paths correctly. The result of the subprocess command is then stored in the `expected` variable.
    *   `.stdout`: The standard output of the subprocess is extracted
    *   `result = await run()`
    *   `Format the contents of {file} using 'prettier@3.4.2', updating the file in-place`  (This is a comment explaining the purpose of the following code)
    *   `result = await read(file)`:  Reads the content of the file specified by the `file` parameter.
    *   `if result != expected:`: Compares the content of the `file` with the expected content after running `prettier`.
    *   `return mismatch(file, expected, result)`:  If there is a mismatch, it calls a function named `mismatch` (assumed to be defined elsewhere), passing the file name, the expected content, and the actual result.
    *   `return True`:  If there is no mismatch, it returns `True`.

*   **Lines 100-101 (Function `a3`):**

    *   `async def a3(email, **kwargs):`: An asynchronous function `a3` takes an `email` and keyword arguments.
    *   `dates = not dateclama`: Code which has been OCR'd incorrectly, likely gets some data related to the email, potentially dates.

**Editor Interface:**

*   The code editor is dark-themed.
*   At the bottom of the image, there is a toolbar. The tab "TERMINAL" is active.

**Overall Purpose:**

The code seems to be part of a system that formats Markdown files associated with emails. It reads the original Markdown, formats it using `prettier`, and then compares the formatted result with the expected output.

**Possible Interpretations/Uses:**

*   Automated Markdown formatting in an email processing system
*   Testing to ensure Markdown files are formatted correctly
*   A tool for automatically cleaning up Markdown formatting in a project

In essence, the image is a snippet of code focusing on Markdown formatting, with clear steps of reading, processing with an external tool ("prettier"), and then comparing results.

My final docker image size is coming 1.25 gb, I am using the ubuntu base image as I thought it would be appropriate given the tasks. Is it ok with that size?

PS - Also I would be running out of token if I need to test again with some other base image now.

Certainly! Let's break down the image you've provided.

**Description:**

The image features a single emoji. It's a yellow face with a slightly exasperated or thoughtful expression. Key features include:

*   **Color:** Primarily yellow skin tone.
*   **Eyes:** The eyes are looking upwards, which adds to the mood of pondering or contemplation. The pupils are brown.
*   **Mouth:** The mouth is a simple, straight horizontal line. Suggesting a lack of expression or a suppressed emotion.

**Overall Impression:**

The emoji likely represents someone who is either:

*   Rolling their eyes internally
*   Thinking hard about something
*   Bored or unimpressed
*   Being sarcastic

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or feature!
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:** The image is of a yellow circular face emoji with a "looking up" expression.

**Key Features:**

Sir in main.py file I’m defining task with different variables . But in evaluate.py tasks are defined by different variables to test and when I’m testing it using python evaluate.py it returns unsuccessful . I’m testing all my tasks of main.py with Postman it returns successful.  
My query is that how the tasks get evaluated and do i need to change my variables in main.py ? And what are the other things i have to change.  
Also plss update evaluate.py fie with phase B tasks

Hi instructors and TAs,  
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.

eg.

* Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response?

I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require.

Thanks,  
Trebhuvan

Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint.

Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve *all tasks using the same function* !

21f2000709:

> I tried cutting it down further but it is affecting the functionality, this is the best I can do, i.e., 610 mb

@carlton @Jivraj

will it be ok? Actually I developed it in a way that require some of the essential dependencies and at this point of time it would be dangerous to alter the way of handling it as I am running short of AIProxy Token credits.

Earlier when I asked this:

21f2000709:

> Any tentative size cutoff for the docker image?

I could have altered my way of handling dependencies but at that point of time there was no clear numbers.

I request you to please allow this time around with this size…

Hi @Rishabh2

What exactly you mean by variables? only one argument is required for running `evaluate.py` that’s an email address.

You need to download both `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py` in same folder and then execute `evaluate.py` using uv.  
`uv run evaluate.py --email $any_email`.

For phase B

Hi @23f1002382  
This is the classic case where you use Prompt engineering to solve your problems. I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.

The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.

What you can do is, **try to fool it using itself.** Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.

After submitting docker image through, it will be pulled and our token will be used.

Things to be checked at your end.  
1. `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` works fine  
2. Above command will start 8000 server so use evaluate.py to test if things are working as expected.

Kind regards.

Hello sir,  
Is yesterday’s session not uploaded to YouTube yet ?

Command to run the image in the docs, seemed to have some error,

The command:  
`podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000`

gives the error:  
`crun: executable file `-e` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found`

However the correct command seems to be:  
`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

This works totally fine.

@Jivraj
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall:**

The image displays a portion of text, likely part of a documentation or instruction manual related to running a software image using `podman`.

**Text Breakdown:**

1.  "• Ensure that running your image via" - This is an introductory statement, implying a condition or step that needs to be met when executing an image.
2.  `podman run $IMAGE_NAME -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 automatically` - This is a command string:
    *   `podman run`: Indicates the execution of an image using podman.
    *   `$IMAGE_NAME`: A placeholder (environment variable) for the name of the image to be run.
    *   `-e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN`:  Specifies an environment variable (`AIPROXY_TOKEN`) and sets its value (also taken from an environment variable).
    *   `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 of the host machine to port 8000 of the container.
    *   `automatically`: Indicates that the port mapping happens automatically.
3.  "serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and" - This explains that the running image makes an API available at the specified URL. The `task=...` suggests that the API expects a "task" parameter.

**Object and Features:**

*   The text is written in a light font color (likely white or light gray) against a dark background (likely dark blue or gray).
*   The command string is highlighted, possibly with a slightly different shade of gray or a background color.
*   There is an ellipsis (...) within the URL, indicating that part of the URL is not fully displayed.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Context:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or console output. The background is dark, and the text is in a light, monospaced font. This suggests a command-line interface environment.

**Command:** The first line shows a command being executed:
`• pradeepmondal.iitm@Pradeeps-MacBook-Air llm-based-automation-agent % podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN" -p 8000:8000 tds-project-pradeep-mondal`

This command is:

*   **`podman run`**: This indicates that the `podman` command-line tool is being used to run a container. `podman` is a container management tool similar to Docker.
*   **`-e AIPROXY_TOKEN="$AIPROXY_TOKEN"`**: This passes an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the container. The value of this variable is taken from the current shell environment.
*   **`-p 8000:8000`**: This maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 inside the container. This is a port forwarding rule.
*   **`tds-project-pradeep-mondal`**: This is likely the name of the container image being run.

**Output:** The following lines are output from the containerized application. They consist of lines beginning with "INFO: ".

*   **`INFO: Started server process [1]`**: This indicates that a server process has started within the container, and its process ID is likely 1.
*   **`INFO: Waiting for application startup.`**:  The application is initializing and waiting for its startup routines to complete.
*   **`INFO: Application startup complete.`**: The application has successfully initialized.
*   **`INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`**: This indicates that a Uvicorn server (an ASGI server implementation often used with Python's FastAPI) is running within the container and listening on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) on port 8000. The message also tells the user how to stop the server (using CTRL+C).

**Summary:** The image shows a user running a containerized application using `podman`. The application is a web server (likely built with Python and Uvicorn) that's running inside the container, accessible on port 8000. The application is using an environment variable AIPROXY_TOKEN for configuration.

One final question @Jivraj @carlton , will our projects be evaluated with our `AIPROXY_TOKEN` or a different one.

Because my project is done but for evaluation if my `AIPROXY_TOKEN` is used, it might be out of credits.

*   **Shape:** The sign is a triangle, with the base pointing downward.
*   **Color:** The triangle is a bright yellow color, which is typical for warning signs.
*   **Symbol:** Inside the triangle is a large, black exclamation point (!). This symbol is a universally recognized indicator of caution or warning.
*   **Overall Impression:** The emoji is a clear representation of a warning or alert. It suggests that attention should be paid to a potential hazard or important information.

Let me know if you'd like a more specific description or have any questions about the image.

> podman run -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=“$AIPROXY\_TOKEN” -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE\_NAME

Yes this is correct command, we will update in project page.
Here's a detailed description of the image based on my observation:

**Subject:** The image is a close-up portrait of a young man.

**Appearance:**
*   **Facial Features:** He has short, dark hair and fair skin. His face has a clean-shaven appearance. He has a slight stubble.
*   **Clothing:** He is wearing a plaid shirt. The pattern consists of white, black and blue.

**Background:**
*   The background is blurred, but it seems to feature greenery, possibly plants or trees.
*   There also appears to be a window visible in the top left corner.

**Overall Impression:** The image has a casual and natural feel. The man is looking directly at the camera.

@Jivraj sir I get this error  
but my app.py is able to get the server running on localhost and not on 0.0.0.  

image1014×190 18.2 KB

  
could you please help ?
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image displays a terminal window, likely from a Linux or Unix-like operating system. It shows a command being executed and the resulting error message.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Terminal Prompt:** `vikramjncasr@ANJANEYA:/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project$` This indicates the current user (`vikramjncasr`), the hostname (`ANJANEYA`), and the current directory (`/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project`).
*   **Command Executed:** `podman run 20511982f949`. The user is running a container using `podman` (a container runtime) with the image ID `20511982f949`.
*   **Error Message:**
    *   `Traceback (most recent call last):` This indicates that a Python error occurred.
    *   `File "/app/app.py", line 1, in <module>`:  The error originated in the Python script `/app/app.py` on line 1.
    *   `import fastapi`: The line of code causing the error is attempting to import the `fastapi` module.
    *   `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`:  This is the root cause of the problem. The Python interpreter cannot find the `fastapi` module.

**Interpretation:**

The image captures a scenario where a Python application running inside a container is failing to start because the `fastapi` library is not installed or available within the container's environment. It suggests that the container image is missing a dependency.

@22f3001307  
Install datagen.py in the same folder from where you are executing evaluate.py.

@vikramjncasr Check how you are executing, use uv or else install required modules globally  
Kind regards

Sir would the belowformat be ok when you evaluate ?  

image985×211 24.1 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a terminal window with text indicating the execution of a Uvicorn server. The prompt "PS C:\IIT_Madras\TDS_Project>" suggests a PowerShell environment within a directory structure.

The command being executed is "uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000". This indicates that the Uvicorn server is being started, serving the application defined in "app:app" (likely a Python application). The "--host 127.0.0.1" flag specifies that the server should listen on the localhost interface (IP address 127.0.0.1), and the "--port 8000" flag indicates that it should listen on port 8000.

The output includes informative messages such as:

*   "Finished server process [30576]"
*   "Started server process [5584]"
*   "Waiting for application startup."
*   "Application startup complete."
*   "Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)" indicating that the server is successfully running.

The final message "127.0.0.1:54184 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 OK" shows that a client from the same machine (127.0.0.1) made a "GET" request for the root path "/" using HTTP/1.1, and the server responded with a 200 OK status code.

@Jivraj @carlton sir can you take my doubt in today’s session please , i have successfully run docker server but endpoints are not working…  

Screenshot 2025-02-13 1659121917×1024 124 KB

  
If anyone have knowledge about this , please help
Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on the text, objects, and features:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a screen capture with three main areas:

1.  **Web Browser (Left Side):** A web browser (likely Chrome or Chromium) is open, displaying the URL `http://localhost:5000`. The content in the browser shows a simple message: `{"detail":"Not Found"}`. This suggests that the requested resource on the server was not found.

2.  **VS Code Editor (Top Right Side):** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is open, displaying a Python file named `app.py`.
    *   **Code:** The code snippet shows parts of a FastAPI application. Key elements include:
        *   Retrieving an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
        *   Raising an Exception if AIPROXY\_TOKEN is not set.
        *   A route defined with `@app.get("/")` that returns the message "Hello from the Automation Agent!".
        *   Imports of FastAPI, HTTPException, Query, PlainTextResponse, and logging.
        *   Configuration for logging deletion attempts.
        *   A delete operation defined with `@app.delete("/delete", response_class=PlainTextResponse)`

3.  **Terminal Window (Bottom Right Side):** A terminal window within VS Code is active. It shows a Git command sequence:

    *   `git push origin main`:  This command is used to push local code changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
    *   The terminal output details the process of enumerating, counting, compressing, and writing objects to the remote repository. The output indicates a successful push.  The repository's URL `https://github.com/Ansh205/LLM_project.git` is visible.

**Key Observations & Inferences:**

*   **Local Development Environment:**  The setup suggests the user is working in a local development environment (indicated by `localhost:5000`).
*   **FastAPI Application:** The code reveals a FastAPI application is being developed.
*   **API Route Issue:** The "Not Found" message in the browser indicates that the requested route might not be correctly defined or that the application isn't fully running. This is further reinforced by the `@app.get("/")` definition in the file `app.py`.
*   **Version Control (Git):**  The terminal output shows that the user has successfully pushed their code changes to a remote Git repository (hosted on GitHub).
*   **Environment Variables:** The code depends on an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN`.
*   **Python Environment:** The terminal shows that the Python version being used is 3.12.3 (within an environment).

In short, the image depicts a developer working on a FastAPI application, encountering a "Not Found" error, and successfully pushing their code to GitHub.

I am also facing the same issue.

```

I sense ‘Authentication Problem’ happens only with the evaluation script, as the curl requests seems to work fine.

```

@Jivraj @carlton Sir i keep getting this error  

image671×109 8.64 KB

  
even though i have downloaded the packages globally and tried installing them by making a venv but nothing seems to work please help
The image shows a terminal output indicating a Python error.  

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Terminal Prompt:** The terminal prompt `(tds-project-1) vidushilinux@swastivivo:~/tds-project-1$` indicates that the user `vidushilinux` is working in the directory `~/tds-project-1` within an environment named `tds-project-1`.

*   **Command Executed:** The command `uv run app.py` was executed. This suggests the user is trying to run a Python script named `app.py` using a tool named "uv."

*   **Traceback:** The output contains a traceback, a report generated when a Python script encounters an error.
    *   `Traceback (most recent call last):` indicates the start of the error report.
    *   `File "/home/vidushilinux/tds-project-1/app.py", line 9, in <module>` states that the error occurred in the file `/home/vidushilinux/tds-project-1/app.py` on line 9, within the module's scope.
    *   `from fastapi import FastAPI` is the specific line of code where the error occurred.

*   **Error:** The error is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`. This means that the Python interpreter cannot find the `fastapi` module that the script is trying to import. This usually indicates that the `fastapi` package is not installed in the current Python environment (the `tds-project-1` environment in this case).

@Jivraj @carlton sir please help

When I am downloading the data folder after processing datagen.py , it is trying to download in root folder and it is facing permission error . how can we overcome this ?  
needs sudo permission all the time…  

image1368×124 19.9 KB
Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Context:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal session.  The session is running in a Linux or Unix-like environment (e.g., macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux).

**Terminal Prompts:**

There are two visible prompts in the image. Both prompts indicate the current user, hostname, and working directory:

*   `vikramjncasr@ANJANEYA:/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1$`

This prompt reveals that the user is "vikramjncasr", the hostname is "ANJANEYA", and the current directory is `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1`. The `$` symbol usually denotes that the user is a regular user (not the root user).

**Command:**

The first prompt is followed by the command: `ls /`.  This is the "list" command ( `ls` ) with the `/` argument specifying the root directory of the file system. The second prompt just shows the cursor after the command has been executed

**Output:**

The output of the `ls /` command displays a list of directories found in the root directory of the file system:
bin, boot, etc, init, lib.usr-is-merged, lost+found, mnt, proc, run, sbin.usr-is-merged, srv, tmp, var, bin.usr-is-merged, dev, home, lib, lib64, media, opt, root, sbin, snap, sys, usr
**Highlighted element**
`tmp` directory is highlighted in green colour

**Interpretation:**

*   The user "vikramjncasr" on host "ANJANEYA" is working within a specific project directory: `/mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1`.  This likely indicates a project called "TDS_Project_1" located within a larger directory structure on a mounted drive (likely a Windows drive, given the `/mnt/c/` path).
*   The user is listing the contents of the system's root directory, which shows common Unix/Linux directories (e.g., `/bin`, `/boot`, `/etc`, `/home`, `/usr`, etc.).

In essence, the image shows a user navigating the Linux file system within a specific project context.

Hello Sir @carlton @Jivraj  
What are implications on missing the project 1.  
Due to some personal reasons I wasn’t able to start any work on my project 1. It seems difficult for me to complete it.  
Could you please tell what will be the implications of missing it. Will I in anyway be able to cover up and pass in the subject doing future assignments and projects?

Thank you

PS: This isn’t any request to extend dates. I accept my fault and respect the dates provided by the team.

Sir I haven’t initaiated the podman earlier.  
Now when i try to use podman using the wsl via the code “sudo apt install -y podman” it is asking for the password…  
The problem is:

1. I haven’t set any password for podman earlier.
2. Though it is asking for password but it is not taking any input.(ie I am unable type anything there).  
   what should I am supposed to do…

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image captures a screenshot of the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) integrated development environment (IDE).
*   The VS Code window is split into two main sections: the editor/terminal area (larger) and a sidebar on the right.

**Editor/Terminal Area:**

*   **Tab Bar:** At the top, tabs are visible including "PROBLEMS", "OUTPUT", "DEBUG CONSOLE", "TERMINAL", "PORTS", and "COMMENTS", with the "TERMINAL" tab currently selected.
*   **Terminal Output:** The terminal displays a series of command-line interactions, specifically involving the `sudo` command and the `apt` package manager.
    *   There are multiple attempts to provide the `sudo` password for the user "ayushcodes2611".  The output indicates that these attempts have repeatedly failed ("Sorry, try again.") and eventually resulted in "3 Incorrect password attempts".
    *   Following the failed password attempts, the output shows the commands:
        *   `sudo apt update`
        *   `sudo passad` (Likely a typo for `passwd` to change password)
        *   `sudo apt install -y podman`
        *   These commands all resulted in the message "sudo: a password is required", likely because the previous password attempts had locked the `sudo` prompt.
*   **Prompt and Path:** The current terminal prompt displays the user, host, and current directory:  `ayushcodes2611@DESKTOP-Q9B006:/mnt/d/TDS/Project$`. This suggests a Linux environment where:
    *   The username is "ayushcodes2611".
    *   The hostname is "DESKTOP-Q9B006".
    *   The current working directory is `/mnt/d/TDS/Project`, which is likely a directory on a mounted Windows drive.

**Sidebar:**

*   Two tabs are present: "powershell" and "wsl", hinting that both Powershell and Windows Subsystem for Linux terminals are configured in VS Code.

**In summary, the image shows a user in a VS Code terminal attempting to update and install packages using `sudo` but failing due to incorrect password attempts. The terminal is configured within a Linux environment through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).**

A silly Doubt though but still a doubt!  
Could we create an image first of our project in initial stage(ie the my “app.py” is not completely ready) but I have build an docker image including the app.py and other dependencies.  
Should I give the same url now and then carry on updating the app.py  
Or, Should first complete and then upload in the form!

plz reply!!

image872×550 16.5 KB

  
pls help with this error
The image displays a series of error messages related to a task involving credit card data processing.

**Key observations:**

*   **Task Description:** The initial task is described as: "Running task: `/data/credit_card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt`".  This outlines the goal of extracting a credit card number from an image and saving it to a text file.

*   **HTTP Request (POST):** A POST request is made to `http://localhost:8000/run` with a URL-encoded task description. The task involves image processing and writing data to a file.

*   **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error:**  The POST request results in a 500 Internal Server Error. The "detail" message in the JSON response indicates that the image file `C:\\Users\\starb\\Desktop\\tds_p_1\\data\\credit_card.png` does not exist. This suggests a problem with the file path or the file itself.

*   **HTTP Request (GET):** A GET request is made to `http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/credit-card.txt` to read the generated text file.

*   **HTTP 404 Not Found:** The GET request receives a 404 Not Found error, indicating that the file `/data/credit-card.txt` does not exist on the server.
*   **A8 Failure:**  The image also shows an error "A8 failed: Cannot read /data/credit-card.txt" and "X A8 FAILED".

*   **HTTP Request (POST - OpenAI Embeddings):** A POST request is made to `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`. This is an OpenAI API endpoint used for generating embeddings (vector representations) of text.  It returns a 401 Unauthorized error.

*   **A9 Failure:** The image shows an error "A9 failed: 'data'" and "X A9 FAILED".

**In summary:** The image depicts a series of errors in a process attempting to extract a credit card number from an image using an LLM. The errors include:

1.  The image file not being found.
2.  The resulting text file not being found.
3.  Authentication issues with an OpenAI API endpoint.

These errors indicate issues with file paths, image availability, and API authentication.

Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image features a colorful, illustrative background with various data-related icons and symbols in a flat design style.
*   Superimposed over the background is a dark blue semi-transparent rectangle with rounded corners.
*   White text is prominently displayed within the rectangle.

**Text:**

*   The text reads "WEEK 5" in large, bold, white letters.
*   Below that, in slightly smaller but still prominent white letters, is "SESSION 1".

**Background Illustrations:**

*   **Top:** There are icons representing things like a target or dashboard, a pencil, a computer screen with data, connected nodes (possibly representing networks), and more pencils.
*   **Middle:** Features icons related to statistics, such as bar graphs, pie charts, computer screen, and world icons with connections.
*   **Bottom:** Shows abstract graphs, and data related icons.

**Color Palette:**

*   The color palette includes shades of blue, teal, orange, red, yellow, and white.

**In Summary:**

The image appears to be a title card or slide for a presentation or educational module, specifically Week 5, Session 1, likely related to data analytics, statistics, or a technology-related topic. The design is clean, modern, and visually appealing with the use of data illustrations as a design element.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Appearance:**

*   The image is of low resolution and blurry, making details somewhat indistinct.
*   The dominant colors are red and green.

**Key Elements:**

1.  **Red Rectangle with Rounded Edges:** There's a prominent red rectangular shape in the center of the image. The edges of the rectangle appear to be slightly rounded.
2.  **White Play Button:** Inside the red rectangle, there is a white, stylized play button (a triangle pointing to the right) with a significant amount of blurring/light diffusion.
3.  **Green Background:** The background surrounding the red rectangle appears to be green. It is also blurred, giving the impression of a soft, out-of-focus backdrop.

**Interpretation:**

*   Given the prominent red rectangle and white play button, it strongly suggests the image is related to **YouTube**. The red rectangle mimics the shape and color scheme of the YouTube logo, and the play button is a direct symbol of video playback on the platform.

In short, it's a representation, likely a pixelated or blurred version, of the YouTube logo.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be a graphic or illustration relating to data science tools. It has a colorful, geometric, and somewhat retro aesthetic.

**Text:**

The central text in the image reads:
*   "TOOLS"
*   "IN"
*   "DATA SCIENCE"

The text is likely the title or heading of the graphic, indicating the topic it addresses. The font is bold, and the text is in a contrasting color (orange/yellow) against a darker background (blue/black) to make it stand out.

**Objects and Features:**

Around the text, there are numerous icons and graphical elements that represent various data science tools and concepts. Some of them are:

*   **Top:**
    *   A pie chart
    *   Data points connected by lines (network or graph representation)
    *   A tablet with a flower (4 dot) icon.
    *   Graph bars
    *   A tool

*   **Bottom:**
    *   A graph
    *   Triangles
    *   Graph Data points connected by lines (network or graph representation)
    *   Arrows, to illustrate growing tendency
    *   A round graph

*   **Behind the Text:**
    *   A Laptop
    *   A globe
    *   A padlock.

**Style and Color Palette:**

*   The image utilizes a limited color palette, with primary colors like blue, yellow, red, and white/beige dominating.
*   The style is somewhat flat and geometric.

**Interpretation:**

The image is likely intended to be visually appealing and informative. The icons surrounding the text likely represent the different tools or concepts associated with data science. The color scheme and style give it a modern yet accessible feel.

Is someone else are also getting this kind of error messages…  
I have a low end system, then shifted to high one then again this popped up…  
Does anyone know how to come over this…
Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) displaying a "The window is not responding" error message.

**Elements and Text:**

*   **VS Code Window:** The main application window is visible in the background, showing code with elements like `led`, `10 == 0`, and `os.environ.get("AIPROXY`.
*   **Error Dialog:** A modal window titled "Visual Studio Code" has popped up, displaying the error message.
    *   The message reads: "The window is not responding. You can reopen or close the window or keep waiting."
    *   An alert icon (yellow triangle with an exclamation point) is displayed to the left of the error message.
*   **Dialog Options:** The error dialog provides the following options:
    *   "Don't restore editors" checkbox
    *   "Reopen" button
    *   "Close" button
    *   "Keep Waiting" button
*   **Terminal:** At the bottom of the VS Code window, the terminal is visible, indicating a PowerShell prompt.

**Interpretation:**

The screenshot indicates that VS Code has become unresponsive, and the operating system has presented a dialog to the user, offering options to either reopen the window (potentially losing unsaved progress), close the application, or wait to see if the application recovers.

**Overall Impression:**

The image portrays a common issue encountered when using VS Code or other software, where the application becomes unresponsive, forcing the user to make a decision on how to proceed.

Hello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini sir, I have implemented the code for B3 & B6 but unfortunately as per the instructions given in project for B3 & B6 —

* **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website
* **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it

They are almost similar and it’s getting confusing in both cases, it’s given output based on B3 and not reading the input for B6, so could you please help me out with this?

Is anyone else facing this or a similar issue?

Two solutions

1. give proper permissions.
2. use docker containers this is what we will test on.

I would prefer 2nd approach

For B tasks use LLM to write code on the fly and execute it, use better prompts. In evaluation script detailed task will be provided with what data needs to be scraped, endpoints, parameters, etc.

Hi,  
If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.

Hi @carlton @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj ,  
In task A6  
**Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `#`  ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ).**

Here expected output JSON “key” is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when “path/to/large-language-models.md” is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is “path/to/large-language-models.md”.

This can easily be checked by runing the evaluate.py file.  
Anyways, a file present in data/docs/folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file should be folder\_a/folder\_b/md\_file as key.

For as task description like this

* Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`

I have given the prompt in such detail to the LLM but it is still not able to understand the task because of the “#” symbol. The task is getting truncated even before it reaches to the LLM.  
Can anyone help me on this because I have tried so many things to fix this but nothing seems to help.

@carlton @Jivraj  
sir i have tried to solve the A1. when I want to check the solution we are asked for the datagen module as the evaluate.py have  
’

```
''from datagen import (
    get_markdown,
    get_dates,
    get_contacts,
    get_logs,
    get_docs,
    get_email,
    get_credit_card,
    get_comments,
    get_tickets,
)
'''

```

so do we need to download the datagen.py in the local system first…

Or it should be the part of the automation only…

Yes I know that but LLM does not know that # indicates number. And no prompt is fixing this issue because the task has to be passed as query parameter and by the time LLM reads the task, it is already half gone due to #.

> ANDIECOOLER2

could you help me out with q2?
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   **Subject:** The image features a partial view of a character that appears to be Monkey D. Luffy from the anime series "One Piece." We only see the lower part of his face, his signature straw hat, and his raised arm/hand.

*   **Facial Features:** We can see his eyes, part of his nose, and a hint of his smiling mouth.

*   **Straw Hat:** He is wearing his distinctive yellow straw hat with a red band around it. A daisy-like flower is attached to the side of the hat.

*   **Raised Hand:** His right arm is raised, with his hand in a possible greeting or signaling gesture.

*   **Background:** The background is a solid, light orange color. There are no other elements or textures in the background.

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a close-up, stylized depiction of Luffy. Due to the framing and limited view, the intention might be to focus on his iconic hat and energetic personality.

image1027×917 28.1 KB
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Code Editor Window:**

*   **Title Bar:** "main.py > ...". This indicates that the currently active file is "main.py".
*   **Code Snippet (Python):**
    *   A function `handle_task_A2` is defined, taking `file_path` (string) and `prettier_version` (string) as arguments.
    *   It checks if `file_path` is not empty and if a file exists at the provided path using `os.path.exists`.
    *   If the file exists, it prints "Path exisit - will perform prettier".
    *   It then uses the `subprocess.run` function to execute a command. The command is likely using `npx` to run `prettier` at a specific version provided by `prettier_version`. The file at `file_path` is targeted for formatting ("--write").
    *   If the file does not exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

**Terminal Output (Below the Code Editor):**

*   Indicates the name of the terminal: `TERMINAL`.
*   **File Path:** "/data/format.md". This shows that the terminal output is related to a file located at this path.
*   **Expected Output (AEXPECTED):**
    *   "\#Unformatted Markdown"
    *   A paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.
    *   A list:
        *   First item
        *   Second item
        *   +Third item
        *   \* Fourth item
        *   \`\`\`py
        *   print("user@example.com")
        *   \`\`\`
*   **Result (ARESULT):**
    *   "\#Unformatted Markdown"
    *   A paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace.
    *   A list:
        *   First item
        *   Second item
        *   +Third item
        *   \* Fourth item
        *   \`\`\`py

**General Impressions:**

The image shows a code editor (likely VS Code) where a Python script formats a markdown file. The script attempts to use `prettier` (a code formatter) to format the markdown file. The terminal output shows that the expected and actual outputs are the same, indicating that the prettier formatting did not change the markdown.

Okay, actually when i tried with local, i’m facing path error

```
./data/format.md

you should manually check if the file really exists or not because i think the code and the folder where datagen.py is downloading files(data folder) are different

If you are using the function calling approach, you could just parse the ‘#’ and change it to ‘number’ and then send the prompt to the llm for that particular task.

Or another approach is tell the llm,

If you ever see the phrase ‘count the # of’ in a task, please interpret it as ‘count the number of’. For example  
Count the # of Fridays means  
Count the number of Fridays

Screenshot 2025-02-14 2018541919×1015 81.4 KB

@carlton @Jivraj this is showing while docker image is running
Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a screenshot of a VS Code (Visual Studio Code) IDE window. The IDE is running on a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instance, specifically Ubuntu 24.04. The layout is typical of VS Code:

*   **Left Sidebar:** Contains the Explorer panel, showing the project's file structure.
*   **Main Editor Area:** Displays the content of the "llm.py" Python file.
*   **Bottom Panel:** Shows the integrated terminal, displaying output and error messages from the running program.

**File Explorer:**

The file explorer in the sidebar shows the following files and directories:

*   `_pycache_`
*   `llm_venv`
*   `.env`
*   `a.py`
*   `app.py`
*   `Dockerfile`
*   `llm.py` (currently open in the editor)
*   `re.txt`

**Content of "llm.py":**

The Python code in "llm.py" seems to be intended to download and execute another Python script (`datagen.py`) from a remote URL:

1.  **Script Header:**
    *   `# /// script`
    *   `#required-python ">-3.11"`
    *   `description` is set to `subprocess`
2.  **Import Statement:**
    *   `import subprocess` (Imports the `subprocess` module which is necessary to run external commands)
3.  **Variable Definitions:**
    *   `script_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sananda/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py'` (Defines the URL from which `datagen.py` will be downloaded)
    *   `arg = '21f3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in'` (Defines an argument that will be passed to `datagen.py`)
4.  **Execution:**
    *   `subprocess.run(['wget', script_url, '-O', 'datagen.py'])` (Uses `wget` to download the script from the `script_url` and saves it as `datagen.py` in the current directory.)
    *   `subprocess.run(['python', 'datagen.py', arg])` (Executes the downloaded `datagen.py` script using the Python interpreter, passing the value of `arg` as a command-line argument)

**Terminal Output:**

The terminal output reveals an error related to the execution of the script. Here's a breakdown of the important parts:

1.  **Initial Information:**
    *   There is an HTTP POST request shown at the beginning with a URL that contains some data, like file names and parameters, indicating interaction with a web server or API.
2.  **Error Traceback:**
    *   The main error is a `NameError`: `name 'subprocess' is not defined`. This means the `subprocess` module was likely not properly imported in `datagen.py`.
3.  **Using subprocess to run Python script with an argument:**
    *   `subprocess.run(['python3', script_path, email_argument])`
4.  **Generated Python Dependencies:**
    *   `{'module': 'subprocess'}`

**Observations:**

*   The intention of the "llm.py" script is to download and execute "datagen.py" with a provided argument.
*   The error message indicates that the `subprocess` module might not have been imported properly within `datagen.py` itself.
*   The error occurred while executing the `app/llm.py` script on line 15.
*   There are multiple attempts to run the task.

In summary, the image displays a Python script that attempts to download and execute another script. The script fails due to a `NameError`, suggesting a missing import statement in the executed script (datagen.py).

Please read the deliverables and evalute section.

datagen.py and evaluate.py were for only for your testing purposes so that you have an idea of the workflow and how the evaluation works. They are NOT part of your project submission.

Only DO what the project page tells you in the deliverables and evalute sections.

Kind regards

sir i am getting this error by running the docker image  

image656×116 3.28 KB

i tried troubleshooting this for hours but no luck could you please tell me what i did wrong here
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Content:**

The image displays a Python traceback, indicating an error that occurred while running a script. Specifically, the error is a `ModuleNotFoundError`, meaning that the Python interpreter could not find a module named "fastapi".

**Text Breakdown:**

*   **Traceback (most recent call last):**: This line signals the start of the traceback information, which helps in debugging Python code. The phrase in parentheses indicates the order in which the calls were made.
*   **File "/app/app.py", line 11, in <module>**: This tells us that the error occurred in the file "app.py", located in the "/app/" directory. The error happened on line 11 within the main script module.
*   **from fastapi import FastAPI**: This is the offending line of code. The Python script attempts to import the `FastAPI` class from a module named `fastapi`.
*   **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'**: This is the error message, clearly stating that the Python interpreter cannot find a module called "fastapi". This typically means that the `fastapi` library is not installed in the environment where the script is being executed.

**Interpretation:**

The image demonstrates a common Python error that arises when a required module is not installed. To resolve the issue, the user needs to install the `fastapi` library using pip or a similar package manager (e.g., `pip install fastapi`).

Hey @carlton @Jivraj , I actually submitted the project already in the morning,  
I included all the deliverables and things mentioned in the evaluation section.

But since I was actively testing with the - `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, I forgot to remove them before submission.

However these files do not play a role in my project execution in any way, they just sit idle. Will there be any issue?

This indicates your task execution returns “HTTP/1.1 200 OK” but the execution doesn’t creates the required file in the given location that the evaluation script is requesting.

22f3001011 I’ve enabled “Allow response editing” on the form. I *think* that means you can edit your response… but since you had submitted it before it was enabled, I’m not sure what the procedure is. Worst case, please submit again.

very true there is too much confusion Id like to ask if you know that evaluate.py is mean to run only for user@example.com or our own mail too because there was written **You MUST use your Student Id** (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) **to do the Project, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation.**

sir why the datagen.py in not created in the tree and the data folder please help me @s.anand @Jivraj @carlton
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text and relevant features:

**Overall Structure**

The image shows the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE on a Linux (Ubuntu) system. The screen is divided into three main sections:

1.  **Explorer Panel (Left):**  Shows the project file structure.

2.  **Code Editor (Center):** Displays the content of a Python file named "Im.py".

3.  **Terminal Panel (Bottom):** Shows the output of running a Python application.

**Explorer Panel Content**

The Explorer panel lists the files and folders in the project:

*   `.\_pycache\_\_`
*   `.venv`
*   `app.py`
*   `datagen.py`
*   `Dockerfile`
*   `Im.py` (highlighted, indicating it's currently open)
*   `re.txt`

**Code Editor Content (Im.py)**

The editor displays the Python code in "Im.py":

```python
11
12
13  import os
14  import subprocess

15
16  # Print the complete path of the /data folder
17  print(os.path.abspath("/data"))
18

19  # Running the Python script with the provided argument
20  script_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py'
21  email_arg = '21fi3002277@ds.study.iitm.ac.in'
22
23  # Download the script
24  response = subprocess.run(['curl', '-O', script_url], check=True)
25
26  # Execute the script using uv
27  subprocess.run(['uv', 'run', 'datagen.py', email_arg], check=True)
```

**Terminal Panel Content**

The Terminal panel shows output from running a Python application (likely `app.py`), including the execution of the script `datagen.py`.

*   **Environment Information:** Displays the virtual environment and current directory: `(llm_venv) root@ikash:/mnt/e/IITM/New/TDS/LLM_18`
*   **Application Startup Messages:** Shows the server starting and the `uvicorn` web server running.

    *   INFO:  Started server process \[12181]
    *   INFO:  Waiting for application startup.
    *   INFO:  Application startup complete.
    *   INFO:  Uvicorn running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` (Press CTRL+C to quit)
*   **Execution Output of `llm.py`:** Contains information about the command execution. It shows the executed process was 'uv', 'run', 'llm.py'.  There's a disclaimer indicating that the script might change before evaluation and should be treated as a guide.
*   **Download and Upload Statistics:** There is information about a downloaded file, showing upload/download speeds, the amount of data, and the download source (probably related to the `curl` command in the `Im.py` script).
*   **HTTP Response:**  "127.0.0.1:55594 - "POST /runTaskrun128 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK". This indicates a successful HTTP POST request to a local server endpoint named `/runTaskrun128`.

**Key Observations and Interpretation**

*   **Data Generation Setup:** The code and terminal output suggest a data generation process is being set up.  `datagen.py` is downloaded and executed.
*   **Email Argument:**  An email address is passed as an argument to `datagen.py`.
*   **Web Server:** The `uvicorn` message indicates that a web server is running, likely serving API endpoints.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The `POST` request likely triggers some action or processing within the application.

Let me know if you want a deeper look into specific parts of the image!

i think you have to run the following command

```
uv run datagen.py <your_email> --root ./data

```

try to include --root ./data in your code

@carlton @Jivraj  
Hello,  
just a silly question, if my code runs well in docker environment with `/data` in root directory, will it be fine ?  
or should i keep the relative `./data` directory like in the lecture ?  
Thanks

The reason in the lecture they were using ./data was because they were debugging in their local machine not in the docker.

For the docker image (the official submission) you must use /data.  
It is a clear requirement mentioned in the project page.

Thats why it works fine when you use it in the docker image.

Kind regards

@Jivraj @carlton  
hello sir i need help here. I have pushed my image into a docker repo and trying to submit it on ht google form. but it is not accepting it and asking to remove the tag .  
What do i do ?
Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Layout:**
The image shows a section of a form, likely online, with two question prompts and corresponding answer fields.

**First Question:**
*   **Question:** "What is the link to your GitHub repository which has the code for Project 1?" (Indicated by a red asterisk denoting it as a required field).
*   **Hint Text:** "It should look like https://github.com/user-name/repository-name"
*   **Answer Field:** "https://github.com/Atimanas-Biswal421/proj1"

**Second Question:**
*   **Question:** "What is the name of the image published on DockerHub?" (Indicated by a red asterisk denoting it as a required field).
*   **Hint Text:** "It should look like user-name/image-name"
*   **Answer Field:** "atimanasbiswal/proj1-tds:final"
*   **Error Message:** Below the answer field, a red exclamation mark icon is present, accompanied by the text "Must match pattern". This indicates the input provided does not adhere to the required formatting.

**Text Elements:**

*   The questions are written in a clear and straightforward manner.
*   The example formats in the hint texts (e.g., "https://github.com/user-name/repository-name", "user-name/image-name") give users a guideline on the type of answer expected.

**General Observations:**

*   The form is asking for the GitHub repository link and the DockerHub image name.
*   The DockerHub image name has a pattern matching error, indicated by the "Must match pattern" message. The tag: "final" is not allowed, the correct format for image name is supposed to be "user-name/image-name:tag".

In essence, the image represents a user filling out an online form and encountering a formatting error while providing the DockerHub image name.

Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Context:**

The image appears to be a screenshot of a computer screen, likely showing a code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The user seems to be working on a Python project involving data processing, specifically related to credit card information. There are indications of testing and debugging.

**Elements Visible:**

*   **Top Menu Bar:** The top of the screen shows a typical menu bar with options like "Selection," "View," "Go," "Run," "Terminal," and "Help."

*   **Tabs:** There are several tabs open in the IDE, named: "taskA2.py," "evaluate.py," and "datagen.py". These likely represent Python files related to the project. The active tab is "data/credit\_card.png" which may be related to the display of image content.

*   **Project File Structure:** A sidebar on the left displays a project directory structure. Notable files and directories include:
    *   `data/` (a directory containing data files)
        *   `credit_card.png` (an image file, likely a credit card image)
        *   `credit_card.txt` (a text file, likely containing credit card number data)
        *   `contacts-sorted.json`
        *   `contacts.json`
        *   Other files (`dates-wednesdays.txt`, `notes.txt`, etc.)
    *   `__pycache__/` (a directory containing compiled Python code)
    *   `taskA1.py` to `taskA10.py` (Python script files, likely related to tasks within the project)

*   **Code Editor Area:** The main area displays what seems to be the content of the `credit_card.png` file or a program that reads this file. A large number (partially obscured, but recognizable) that looks like a credit card number: "4390 6622 2036 7260"

*   **Output/Terminal Window:** A lower panel displays output or a terminal-like interface. This panel is in "TERMINAL" mode. The important content here shows a comparison between expected and actual results:
    *   File `/data/credit-card.txt` is being tested.
    *   `EXPECTED: 4390652220367260078` (the expected credit card number)
    *   `RESULT: 4390652220367260` (the actual result obtained by the program)
    *   `X AB FAILED` (Indicates that the test failed, as the result doesn't match the expected value)
    *   A log message for the HTTP Request: `HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/`
    *   `A falled: 'data'` (Possibly indicating that some data was not correctly sent to the API)
    *   `X AB FAILED`

*   **Other:** Text fragments "ALID", "HRU" are also visible which may refer to some variables/configurations.

**Key Features & Inferences:**

1.  **Credit Card Number Extraction/Processing:** The project likely aims to extract credit card numbers from images or other sources and perform some processing or validation on them.
2.  **Testing:** The output indicates that the program is being tested against a known "expected" value for a credit card number.
3.  **Error:** The test fails because the extracted/processed credit card number (RESULT) does not match the expected value. There's a difference in the extracted numbers.
4.  **API Integration:** The presence of an HTTP request suggests that the project interacts with an external API, possibly for validation or processing the credit card information.

In essence, the image shows a snapshot of a software development environment where a credit card processing/extraction program is being tested, and a test has failed due to a discrepancy between the expected and actual results.

why do i get this error? can someone please help me out @Jivraj @carlton…Anyone pls help
The image displays a response from an HTTP request, specifically an error response. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Status Code:** 500 Internal Server Error. This indicates a general error occurred on the server side while processing the request.
*   **Size:** 184 Bytes. This is the size of the response body.
*   **Time:** 792 ms. This indicates the time taken for the request-response cycle.
*   **Response Body:** The response body is in JSON format, indicated by the surrounding curly braces `{}`.
    *   The JSON contains a single field named "detail."
    *   The value of "detail" is a string explaining the error. It states "Error code: 401."
    *   The details then specifies that the error is related to authentication: "'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.'"
    *   Further details are given within the "error" object:
        *   'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.'
        *   'type': 'invalid\_request\_error'
        *   'param': None
        *   'code': 'invalid\_issuer'
*   **Other UI Elements:**
    *   Tabs labeled "Response," "Headers," "Cookies," "Results," and "Docs." The "Response" tab is currently selected, indicating that the response body is being displayed.
    *   The header "Headers" has a subscript "5" indicating that there may be five headers.
    *   Braces at the end "{}" could symbolize a JSON structure.
    *   Three lines symbol "≡" means a collapse.

In summary, the image shows an error response from a server indicating an authentication problem. The authentication token provided in the request is not from a trusted source or issuer. The 500 error might indicate that the server encountered an internal issue while verifying the token's validity, even though the error ultimately relates to the client's authentication attempt.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

*   **Main Element:** The image contains the letter "S" in white. It appears to be a lowercase "s".
*   **Background:** The background is a teal or turquoise color.
*   **Texture:** The letter "s" has a slightly blurred or soft-focus appearance.

The image appears to be a simple graphic or icon consisting of the letter "s" against a solid-colored background. It doesn't contain any other objects or complex features.

The image is a JSON object containing a single key-value pair. The key is "message", and its value is a string. The string states: "On 2025-02 you used $2.0037491399999996, exceeding $2". This message indicates a usage event on February 2025, where the amount used was $2.0037491399999996, which is slightly over the $2 limit.

it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)  
then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.  
Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.  
create a venv using python3 -m venv name\_of\_venv  
add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location  
and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.  
It even happened for me

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Context:**

The image shows a terminal window, likely from a Linux environment (specifically Arch Linux, as indicated by the username "jaideep@archlinux"). It captures the results of attempting to install the `numpy` Python package using `pip`.

**Key Text and Commands:**

1.  **`jaideep@archlinux - pip3 install numpy`**
    *   This is the initial command. It attempts to install the `numpy` package using `pip3` (likely the Python 3 version of pip).

2.  **`error: externally-managed-environment`**
    *   This is a critical error message. It indicates that the Python environment is managed externally (likely by the system's package manager, `pacman` in the case of Arch Linux). This means `pip` is being prevented from directly modifying the system-wide Python installation.

3.  **Explanatory Text:**
    *   Following the error, there's a block of helpful text providing guidance:
        *   **"This environment is externally managed"** - Reiterates the reason for the error.
        *   **"To install Python packages system-wide, try `pacman -S python-xyz`, where xyz is the package you are trying to install."** - Suggests using `pacman` (Arch Linux's package manager) to install packages that are available as system packages.
        *   **"If you wish to install a non-Arch-packaged Python package, create a virtual environment using `python -m venv path/to/venv`."** - Recommends using a virtual environment for packages not available through `pacman`.
        *   **"If you wish to install a non-Arch packaged Python application, It may be easiest to use `pipx install xyz`, which will manage a virtual environment for you. Make sure you have python-pipx installed via pacman."**  - Suggests using pipx.
        *   **"note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages."** - Cautions against overriding the system's package management and provides a potentially risky way to force `pip` to install the package.

4.  **`jaideep@archlinux - source /home/jaideep/.python3/bin/activate`**
    *   This command is used to activate a Python virtual environment. It seems the user has already created a virtual environment and is now activating it.

5.  **`jaideep@archlinux - pip3 install numpy`**
    *   The user attempts to install `numpy` again, presumably *after* activating the virtual environment.

6.  **`Requirement already satisfied: numpy in .../python3.13/site-packages (2.2.2)`**
    *   This indicates that `numpy` is already installed *within* the virtual environment. The path shows where it's located within the environment.
    *   The (2.2.2) indicates the version of `numpy` that is already installed.

7.  **`jaideep@archlinux -`**
    *   This is the final line, showing the terminal prompt, indicating that the command has completed and the user is ready for the next command.

**In summary:** The image captures a common issue on Arch Linux-based systems where `pip` is restricted from modifying the system Python installation.  The user receives an "externally-managed-environment" error, is advised to use `pacman` or a virtual environment, and successfully installs `numpy` after activating a virtual environment.

Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Image Content:**

The image is a digital representation of a warning sign. It features the following:

*   **Shape:** The sign is triangular.
*   **Color:** The triangle is a bright, cautionary yellow.
*   **Symbol:** Centered within the yellow triangle is a large, dark gray or black exclamation point ("!").
*   **Style:** The image has a slightly glossy or 3D appearance, as if it's an icon or digital rendering.
*   **Resolution:** The image appears to be somewhat pixelated, suggesting it may be of a lower resolution or a close-up view of a smaller icon.

**In summary:** The image is a straightforward depiction of a classic warning symbol, commonly used to indicate potential hazards or the need for caution.
 Okay, I can describe the content of the image in detail.

The image shows a yellow warning sign in the shape of an equilateral triangle. Inside the triangle, there is a large, black exclamation mark. The exclamation mark is positioned in the center of the triangle, pointing upwards. The background of the image is black.

Essentially, it's a standard warning or attention symbol.

Can you please make the changes in the datagen.py file

This is where I have been facing the issue.

The only solution I can think of is moving the /data folder from the root to the project directory. which I am not sure is a good way to solve this issue.

Here's a description of the image's content:

The image is a screenshot from a Google Meet video call. The background is black. In the center of the screen is a large orange circle with the white letter "T" inside. This likely represents a user with the initial "T" for their name, and the video camera is off. In the top right corner, the Google Meet logo is displayed. At the bottom left corner of the screen, the name "TELVIN VARGHESE" is printed in white text. This is likely the name of the person in the Google Meet.

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Content:**

*   **Main Element:** The image features a solid red circle or sphere. It has a slightly glossy or shiny appearance, suggesting it might be made of plastic or another smooth material.
*   **Color:** The color of the circle is a vibrant red.
*   **Background:** The background is plain black, which helps the red circle stand out.
*   **Pixelation:** The image appears to be low-resolution and slightly pixelated, meaning the edges of the circle are not perfectly smooth.

**Interpretation:**

The image is a simple representation of a red circle. It could be a graphic icon, a button, or a visual element from a larger design. The simplicity suggests it could be used for various purposes, such as a marker, a status indicator, or a decorative element.

**Content:**

The image shows a single, prominent **red "X"**. The "X" appears to be a graphic or digital illustration, rather than a photograph of a physical object.

**Visual Characteristics:**

*   **Color:** The "X" is a solid red color.
*   **Shape:** It is clearly in the shape of a capital "X". The arms of the "X" are of a uniform thickness.
*   **Style:** The "X" has a slightly rounded, cartoonish style. The edges appear smoothed or rounded, and there's a subtle light highlight that suggests a glossy or three-dimensional effect.
*   **Background:** The background is solid black, which provides strong contrast with the red "X".

**Interpretation:**

The "X" likely represents a symbol for:

*   **Cancellation**
*   **Rejection**
*   **Removal**
*   **Error**
*   **Deletion**

The specific meaning would depend on the context in which this image is used.

you have to give the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` to the evaluate.py by either  
bash - `export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
or  
powershell - `$env:AIPROXY_TOKEN="your token"`  
the evaluate.py file takes the token to send request to embedding end point for processing.  
so you have to set `AIPROXY_TOKEN` in both terminals  
i.e. app.py and evaluate.py teminals

when I run the evaluation file, i get the following error -  Running task: Install `uv` (if required) and run the script `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/datagen.py` with `user@example.com` as the only argument  A1 failed: All connection attempts failed  A1 FAILED

I am getting the following error when running the evaluation scripts, can someone help me understand what this error is?
Here's a detailed description of the image:

*   **Shape:** The image prominently features a circular shape.
*   **Color:** The circle is predominantly yellow in color. It appears to be a solid, uniform shade of yellow with a slight variation in tone suggesting some degree of light reflection.
*   **Texture/Appearance:** The circle has a smooth, glossy appearance. There's a subtle hint of a lighter, reflective spot, suggesting a polished or shiny surface.
*   **Background:** The circle is set against a solid black background, providing a high level of contrast that makes the yellow circle stand out.
*   **Digital Appearance:** The image seems to have a slightly pixelated quality. This suggests that it might be a low-resolution image or possibly a digital rendering of a simple object.
*   **Potential Object Representation:** Based on the appearance, the circle could represent a coin, a button, or a generic graphical element.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image features a single, solid **red circle** on a black background.
*   The circle has a smooth, slightly glossy surface, suggesting it could be a 3D render or illustration of a round object.
*   The color is a vibrant red, possibly leaning toward a coral or tomato shade.
*   There are visible pixelations around the edges of the circle, indicating that it might be a low-resolution image or a close-up of a larger image.
*   The circle has a subtle light reflection on its upper left side, adding a touch of depth and dimension.

**Interpretation:**

The image is simple and straightforward. It is a basic geometric shape with an indication of texture, color and lighting. The pixelations suggest that the image may be a screen capture of something lower resolution.
 Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Content:**

The image features a single red "X" symbol. It is presented against a solid black background.

**Features:**

*   **Shape:** The "X" is formed by two intersecting diagonal lines.
*   **Color:** The "X" is a bright, vibrant red.
*   **Style:** The "X" appears to have a slightly rounded, cartoonish or emoji-like style, as the edges are smooth and softened.
*   **Background:** The background is a uniform black, providing strong contrast and making the red "X" stand out prominently.

**Potential Interpretations and Questions:**

This image is a common symbol that may indicate:

*   **Error:** It could signify an error, rejection, or incorrect answer.
*   **Removal or Deletion:** It may mean something needs to be removed or deleted.

Here is a detailed description of the image content:

**Image Context:**

The image is a screenshot of a terminal window on a computer.  The user "Nelson" is running commands within a bash shell. The terminal appears to be connected to a cloud-based project called "TDS-Project-1-LLM."

**Text and Code:**

1. **Shell Prompt:** The terminal shows standard shell prompts, like `Nelson TDS-Project-1-LLM $`.
2. **Environment Variable:**
   - The command `export AIPROXY_TOKEN=eyJhbGci0iJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1bWFpbCI6IjIyZjEwMDEyOTBAZHMuc3R1ZHkuawl0b:` is used to set an environment variable named `AIPROXY_TOKEN`. The value is a long string likely a JWT (JSON Web Token), used for authentication.
3. **cURL Command:**  The most prominent command is a `curl` command:
   - `curl -X POST http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["king", "queen"]}'`
   - `-X POST`: Specifies the HTTP method as POST.
   - `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`: This is the URL that the curl command is sending a request to.  It looks like an endpoint for getting text embeddings.
   - `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: Sets the HTTP header to indicate that the body of the request is in JSON format.
   - `-d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["king", "queen"]}'`: This provides the data (the payload) for the POST request. The JSON payload specifies:
     - `"model": "text-embedding-3-small"`: The model to use for generating embeddings (likely from OpenAI).
     - `"input": ["king", "queen"]"`:  The input text for which to generate embeddings.  It's asking for the embedding of the words "king" and "queen".
4. **Output of the cURL command:**
   - The subsequent lines in the terminal are the output of the `curl` command.  It shows information about the progress of the command:
     - `% Total`, `% Received`, `% Xferd`: Percentage of the download.
     - `Dload`, `Upload`: Download and upload speeds.
     - `Total`, `Spent`, `Left`: Timings.
     - `Current Speed`: The current transfer speed.
   - Below this, the actual JSON response data is printed, which represents the embedding of "king" and "queen":
      - `"object": "list"`:  Indicates a list of data.
      - `"data": [...]`: The data array.
      - Inside the "data" array, there's an object with:
          - `"object": "embedding"`:  Confirms the content is an embedding.
          - `"index": 0`: Represents the index of this embedding.
          - `"embedding": [...]`: This is the actual numerical representation (vector) of the embedding. It's a list of floating-point numbers, beginning with 0.03722809, -0.022083601, 0.051916726, etc. This numerical data represents the semantic meaning of "king" (or "queen", based on the array index and the request).

**Key Features:**

*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The screenshot highlights an API call related to generating text embeddings.
*   **OpenAI:** The API endpoint name `/openai/` suggests the use of an OpenAI model.
*   **JSON:** Both the request data and the response data are formatted in JSON.
*   **Authentication:** The presence of an `AIPROXY_TOKEN` indicates that the API likely requires authentication.

In summary, the image shows a developer using the `curl` command to request text embeddings from an OpenAI API endpoint using a specific model and providing "king" and "queen" as inputs. The terminal then displays the resulting numerical embedding vectors, which represent the meaning of these words in a high-dimensional space.
 Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Overall:**

The image shows a PowerShell terminal window.  A `curl` command is being executed to make a POST request to a remote API. The command appears to be attempting to use an API proxy for OpenAI embeddings.  The API is returning an error indicating a missing authorization header.

**Detailed Elements:**

*   **Terminal Window:** The title bar indicates "PowerShell 7 (x64)".
*   **PowerShell Prompt:** `PS C:\Users\Nelson>` This shows the current directory is within the user "Nelson" directory.
*   **`curl` Command:** This is the core of the image. Let's break it down:
    *   `curl -X POST http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`
        *   `curl`: The command-line tool for making HTTP requests.
        *   `-X POST`:  Specifies that this is a POST request (sending data to the server).
        *   `http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings`: The URL of the API endpoint being called. This strongly suggests that the request is going to a proxy server hosted on Cloudflare Workers to access OpenAI's embedding API.
    *   `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`:  Sets the `Content-Type` header to indicate that the data being sent is in JSON format.
    *   `-H "Authorization: Bearer $AIPROXY_TOKEN"`:  Sets the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme. The token is expected to be stored in the environment variable `$AIPROXY_TOKEN`.  This is *intended* to provide authentication to the API.
    *   `-d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["king", "queen"]}'`:  This provides the data (the payload) being sent in the POST request.  The data is in JSON format, specifying:
        *   `"model": "text-embedding-3-small"`:  Indicates the OpenAI embedding model to be used.
        *   `"input": ["king", "queen"]`: Specifies the input text for which embeddings are requested.
*   **API Response:** The output shows a JSON response:
    *   `{ "message": "Missing Authorization: Bearer header. See https://github.com/sanando/ai proxy" }` This is an error message from the server. It indicates that the `Authorization` header was either not present or not valid. The error message suggests that the problem and a possible solution can be found on a GitHub repository (`https://github.com/sanando/ai`). This likely indicates an issue with the way the `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` variable is being handled.

**Interpretation:**

The user is attempting to use a proxy to access the OpenAI embeddings API. The `curl` command seems to be constructed correctly, but the API returns an error indicating a missing or invalid `Authorization` header. The most likely reason is that the `$AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable is either not set or contains an incorrect value. It could also be a formatting issue with how the variable is used in the command.

Here's a detailed description of the image's content:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of a web browser displaying a JSON response. The browser's address bar shows a local server address.

**Web Browser Elements:**

*   **Address Bar:** The address bar displays:
    *   `127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install uv` (in the tab title)
    *   `127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install%20` (in the address input)
*   **Navigation Buttons:** Standard browser navigation buttons are visible (back, refresh)
*   **"Pretty-print" Checkbox:**  A checkbox labeled "Pretty-print" suggests the JSON can be formatted for easier reading.

**JSON Content:**

The primary content of the image is a JSON object. Here's a breakdown of the structure and content:

*   **Structure:** The JSON object has two key-value pairs:
    *   `"files"`: An array of strings representing filenames or directory names.
    *   `"message"`: A string providing a status message.
*   **`"files"` Array Contents:** The array contains the following strings:
    *   "comments.txt"
    *   "contacts.json"
    *   "credit\_card.png"
    *   "dates.txt"
    *   "docs" (likely a directory)
    *   "email.txt"
    *   "format.md"
    *   "logs" (likely a directory)
    *   "ticket-sales-gold.txt"
    *   "ticket-sales.db"
*   **`"message"`:** The value associated with the `"message"` key is: "Data generation complete"

**Interpretation:**

The image indicates that a task named "Install" (based on the URL) has completed and has resulted in the creation of several files/directories. The "files" array lists these generated files. The "message" confirms the successful completion of the data generation.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a single, bright yellow circle. It's a simple, flat graphic.

**Features:**

*   **Shape:** It's a perfect circle.
*   **Color:** The circle is a uniform, vibrant yellow.
*   **Lighting:** There appears to be a subtle highlight or sheen in the upper-left area, suggesting a light source from that direction. This gives the circle a slight sense of depth.
*   **Border:** The edge of the circle appears to have a slightly darker yellow outline, which helps to define the shape against the black background.
*   **Pixelated:** The image appears to be slightly pixelated, suggesting it may be a low-resolution image or a detail extracted from a larger image.
*   **Background:** The circle is set against a plain black background.

In short, it's a basic graphic of a yellow circle. The simple design and lighting suggest it might be an icon or a part of a larger graphic design.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

*   **Main Feature:** The image primarily shows a red circle or sphere. It's a simple, cartoonish representation of a solid red ball.
*   **Color:** The dominant color is a bright, saturated red. There are slight variations in the red shade, indicating a potential light source and shading to give it a 3D appearance.
*   **Shape:** The shape is a perfect circle, giving the impression of a two-dimensional representation of a sphere.
*   **Details:**
    *   There are lighter areas, likely representing highlights, to create a sense of depth.
    *   The edges are slightly softer, contributing to the smooth, rounded appearance.
*   **Background:** The background is completely black, which makes the red circle stand out prominently.
*   **Resolution:** The image seems to be of relatively low resolution or pixelated, giving it a retro or simple digital art feel.

In summary, the image is a basic illustration of a red ball on a black background.
 Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Content:**

The image contains a single, prominent element:

*   **A Red "X" Mark:** The central focus is a stylized, red "X" symbol. The "X" appears to be rendered in a cartoonish or emoji-like style. It's a solid red color with slightly rounded edges and a subtle highlight effect, giving it a slightly glossy or 3D appearance.

**Context and Features:**

*   **Color:** The red color is vibrant and attention-grabbing, indicating a potential meaning of "error," "incorrect," "cancel," or "delete."
*   **Shape:** The shape is the traditional "X" which is a universally understood symbol.
*   **Emoji Style:** The overall appearance is similar to an emoji, which suggests a digital or internet-based context.
*   **Background:** The background is solid black, providing a high contrast with the red "X" and further emphasizing it.

**Possible Interpretations:**

Based on the visual cues, the image could be used to:

*   Indicate a negative answer (e.g., in a quiz or survey).

Even the markdown file shows the correct email. What are the possible issues that I could be facing with this one.
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:** The image shows a code editor (likely VS Code) with a Markdown file open called "format.md". The Markdown file contains a mix of unformatted text, a simple list, and a Python code snippet.

**Details:**

*   **File Tabs:** The top of the image displays file tabs: ".env", "app.py", "evaluate.py", and "format.md". The "format.md" tab is currently selected (indicated by the "X" next to it, suggesting it's the active file). There's a directory structure "data >" shown as part of the "format.md" filepath.

*   **Markdown Content:**
    *   **Line 1:** `#Unformatted Markdown` (A level 1 heading).
    *   **Line 3:** "This is a sample paragraph with extra spaces and trailing whitespace." (A paragraph of text).
    *   **Lines 4-7:** An unordered list using different list markers (`-`, `+`, `*`). The list items are "First item", "Second item", "+Third item", and "* Fourth item".

*   **Code Block:**
    *   **Lines 9-12:** A Python code block enclosed in triple backticks (` ``` `).
    *   **Line 9:** ` ``` py` (Specifies a Python code block).
    *   **Line 10:** `print("user@example.com")` (A Python print statement that outputs an email address).
    *   **Line 12:** ` ``` ` (Closes the code block).

In essence, the image shows an example Markdown file that hasn't been properly formatted. It includes a title, a paragraph, an unordered list, and a small Python code snippet, all in the "format.md" document.

@s.anand  
Respected Sir,  
I sincerely request you to kindly consider granting a one-day extension for Project 1. Many key clarifications were provided in today’s session, and we need just one additional day to effectively implement them. This extension would be immensely helpful in ensuring a more refined submission.  
I truly appreciate your time and consideration.  
Thank you.

hey I have a few doubts, if something was said about this please say so.

1. in Phase be tasks do we have to store the output in files or just return it in the response
2. When I call my some of my endpoints using post man or CURL they work but if I run the evaluate.py it throws an error, this I think is a bug in the eval.py file.

any idea about these ?

facing the issue on submission  

image942×521 28.7 KB
The image shows two questions from what appears to be an online form.

The first question asks for the link to a GitHub repository containing the code for "Project 1." An example link format, `https://github.com/user-name/repository-name`, is provided for guidance.  The response given is: `https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Ja`.

The second question asks for the name of an image published on DockerHub, with the requested format being "user-name/image-name".  The response given is `rsjay1976/tds-project1-Jan25`.  Below this answer is a red exclamation mark and the text "Must match pattern," which indicates that the entered value doesn't meet a required format.

can someone help me fix this error @Jivraj @carlton
The image shows a Python traceback indicating an error when initializing the OpenAI client. Specifically, the code tries to initialize `client = OpenAI()` in the file `/app/app.py` on line 35. The traceback then points to the `openai/_client.py` file (line 110) where an `OpenAIError` is raised. The error message states: "The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable". This means the OpenAI client requires an API key to be either directly passed during initialization (e.g., `client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")`) or set as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The "AAAAAAA" likely refers to the parameters that were expected to be passed, but were not.

Blunder in your `main.py`.  
You are using API\_KEY = os.getenv(“AI\_PROXY\_TOKEN”) but it should be AIPROXY\_TOKEN.

Btw what you using for phase B?

What we expect in project.

1. server running inside docker container at 8000.
2. And all files will be accessed from data folder in root directory.

Apart from these two you can have anything extra.

Screenshot 2025-02-15 2128261903×492 32.1 KB

  
how to fix this error ?
Here is a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features:

**Context:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or console output during a Docker build process. It shows commands being executed and the output, including an error message.

**Text Content:**

*   **Prompt Lines:**  `PS C:\Projects\tds_project_1> docker login` and `PS C:\Projects\tds_project_1> docker build -t pratik007thala/automation-agent` These lines indicate commands being run in a Powershell environment (PS). The first command is a Docker login, and the second is a Docker build command.
*   **Login Status:** `Authenticating with existing credentials...` followed by `Login Succeeded` indicate the Docker login was successful.
*   **Build Process Output:** `[+] Building 3.4s (3/3) FINISHED` means the Docker build process finished in 3.4 seconds
*   **Build steps and timings:** `=> [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile` `=> => transferring dockerfile: 855B` are internal docker commands.
*   **Error Message:** `ERROR [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim-bookworm` This is the most significant part, showing an error occurred while trying to load metadata for the Python Docker image.
*   **Dockerfile Line:** `1 | >>> FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm`  This shows line 1 of a Dockerfile that includes the python 3.12 slim bookworm image.
*    **Error Detail:**
    `ERROR: failed to solve: python:3.12-slim-bookworm: failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/python:3.12-slim-bookworm: failed to copy: httpReadSeeker: failed open: failed to do request: Get "htt ps://docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/registry-v2/docker/registry/v2/blobs/sha256/6f/6f3c6367c5a38963f84310cbb24dfcfbddab1dad40cff18afb8fe89098891f08/data?X-Amz-Algo rithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=f1baa2dd9b876aeb89efebbfc9e5d5f4%2F20250215%2Fauto%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250215T155621Z&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=6a5df481b2 ba334e8d27f55c73e4b1e8888c97f7cd58ca711248a77402453c6e": dialing docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443 container via direct connection because static system has no HT TPS proxy: connecting to docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com:443: dial tcp: lookup docker-images-prod.6aa30f8b08e16409b46e0173d6de2f56.r2.cloudflarestorage.com: no such host` This section gives the full details of the error and appears to indicate a failure to contact the docker image registry.

*   **View Build Details:** `View build details: docker-desktop://dashboard/build/desktop-linux/desktop-linux/dhxc8xfhzd1m71ur9lgrwf9wn` A link is provided to view more details in the Docker Desktop dashboard.

**Objects/Features:**

*   **Color Coding:** The output uses color coding (e.g., blue for commands, red for errors) to highlight different aspects of the process.
*   **Line Numbers:**  The `Dockerfile:1` and the subsequent numbered lines from the Dockerfile snippet give context to the error.
*   **URL:** The detailed error message contains a URL for accessing the image metadata. The URL includes parameters like X-Amz-Algorithm, X-Amz-Credential, etc., which suggest the image is being accessed from AWS infrastructure.
*   **Filename:**  It states that the image is using the Dockerfile named "Dockerfile".

**Interpretation:**

The build process failed while trying to download the specified Python image from Docker Hub (or another configured registry). The error indicates a problem connecting to the Docker image registry. This can happen due to DNS resolution issues, network connectivity problems, issues related to proxy settings, or potential problems with the Docker registry itself.

**Subject:** Request for Project Deadline Extension

Dear Sir,

This project is highly complex, and we need additional time to ensure its successful completion. We kindly request an extension of the deadline to allow for thorough testing and proper implementation. An extension would greatly help us deliver the best results.

This might be problem with network settings(unstable internet, firewall, VPN interference)

try to debug it with help of chatgpt.

You can also use codespaces for trying another network.

image266×559 12.5 KB

  
this is what i am doing first using the podman given in the portal and then running the evaluate.py file
The image shows a file directory structure in a code editor, likely VS Code. Here's a breakdown:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The project's root is `TDS-Project-1`.
*   There's a subdirectory named `tds-project-1`.
*   Inside `tds-project-1`, there is an `app` folder and a `data` folder.

**Key Folders & Files:**

*   `_pycache_`: Several of these are visible, which are Python's compiled bytecode directories. These are automatically generated.
*   `.venv`: This indicates a Python virtual environment.
*   `app`: Appears to be a main application directory. Inside of app has `_pycache_` folder
*   `data`: Seems to hold data-related files. It contains:
    *   `__init__.py`: Makes the directory a Python package.
    *   `funtion_tasks.py`
    *   `main.py`
    *   `task_to_embed.txt`: A text file.

**Loose Files (Outside the `app` directory):**

*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `datagen.py`: A Python script (likely for data generation), marked with "2, U," which might indicate it has 2 uncommitted changes in the Git repository.
*   `Dockerfile`: Used to automate the creation of Linux container images.
*   `evaluate.py`: A Python script (likely for evaluating a model or system), marked with "3, U," which might indicate it has 3 uncommitted changes in the Git repository.
*   `README.md`: A Markdown file, likely providing project documentation.
*   `LICENSE`: Specifies the project's licensing information.

**In summary,** the image shows a Python project with a typical structure, including directories for the application (`app`) and data (`data`), as well as common files like `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.gitignore`. The presence of `datagen.py` and `evaluate.py`, along with the "U" marks, indicates a likely machine learning or data-related project that uses version control.

No don’t do that, just follow the procedure.  
Two problems with keeping token in file.

1. It will become public after you push to github.
2. While running evaluation script after submission your token might run out of credits.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image is a digital emoji.
*   **Facial Expression:** The emoji is a bright yellow face with a mixed expression. It appears to be a blend of sadness and pleading. The eyes are large and wide, with visible tears streaming down. Despite the tears, the mouth is shaped into a small, gentle smile.
*   **Eyes:** The eyes are large, brown and shiny, with white highlights suggesting a pleading or hopeful gaze.
*   **Tears:** Light blue tears are prominently displayed under each eye, indicating sadness or emotional distress.
*   **Mouth:** The mouth is a small, slightly curved smile, which adds a layer of complexity to the emotion being expressed. It suggests a sense of hopefulness or a desire to please despite the sadness.
*   **Eyebrows:** The eyebrows are arched and angled slightly inward, reinforcing the emotional display of sadness or concern.
*   **Color:** The face is a standard emoji yellow, while the tears are light blue.
*   **Overall Impression:** The overall impression is that of a face expressing a mix of emotions - sadness and perhaps a desire for sympathy or a plea for something.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   **Subject:** The image depicts a yellow emoji face.
*   **Facial Features:**
    *   Large, glossy brown eyes with a white highlight spot in each, giving them a pleading or puppy-dog look.
    *   Eyebrows that are arched upwards towards the center, giving a concerned or worried expression.
    *   A small, closed-mouth smile, implying either forced happiness or a mixture of emotions.
    *   Blue tears welling up in the eyes and flowing down the cheeks.
*   **Overall Impression:** The emoji appears to convey a blend of sadness, pleading, and potentially forced positivity. It is often used to express emotional sensitivity, vulnerability, or trying to be cheerful despite feeling sad.
 Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

@Jivraj sir @carlton sir do have to add datagen in the docker container?

image706×193 6.15 KB

  
someone please help me fix this error
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image shows a developer tool, likely an API testing or debugging tool.
*   It displays the "Response" tab, suggesting that this is the result of an API request.
*   There are other tabs visible: "Headers", "Cookies", "Results", and "Docs". The "Headers" tab has a "5" badge, likely indicating the number of headers received.

**JSON Content:**

*   The response is formatted as a JSON object, indicated by the curly braces `{}`.
*   It contains a single key named "detail."
*   The value associated with the "detail" key is a string that describes an error.

**Error Message Analysis:**

*   The error message starts with "Error code: 401".  HTTP 401 indicates an "Unauthorized" error, meaning the request lacked proper authentication credentials.
*   The core of the error explains why the request was unauthorized: "Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer."
*   The message further breaks down the error into an inner object with keys like 'error', 'message', 'type', 'param', and 'code'.
*   'type' is "invalid\_request\_error", suggesting the error is related to the structure or parameters of the request.
*   'code' is "invalid\_issuer".  This pinpoints the specific problem to the issuer of the authentication token. The server does not trust the source of the token.
*   'param' is "None" implying that the error isn't associated with a specific parameter.

**Interactive Element:**

*   There's a "Copy" button, which presumably allows the user to copy the entire JSON response to the clipboard.

*   He is wearing a beige kurta-style shirt with a Mandarin collar and dark brown button details down the front.
*   He has a bracelet on his left wrist, and a beaded bracelet on his right.
*   He looks directly at the camera with a slight smile.

**Background:**

*   The background consists of a wall covered in greenery.
*   To the left of the frame, there is a door or window frame.
*   There appear to be stone steps or a stone wall at the base of the frame.

On my system evaulate.py is throwing an error on A2 trying to execute npx on format.md before the llm is even invoked. However running the command directly on the command line works.

evaluate.py:  
 A2 failed: Command ‘[‘npx’, ‘prettier@3.4.2’, ‘–stdin-filepath’, ‘data/format.md’]’ returned non-zero exit status 2.

A2 FAILED

bash:  
npx prettier@3.4.2 --stdin-filepath data/format.md

bash works as expected. Can someone help?
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image depicts a single, stylized red circle on a black background.

**Key Features:**

*   **Shape:** The primary element is a perfect circle.
*   **Color:** The circle is predominantly red, with a gradient effect that suggests a light source coming from the upper-left. This gives the circle a slightly glossy or three-dimensional appearance.
*   **Background:** The background is uniformly black, providing contrast that makes the red circle stand out.
*   **Style:** The circle has a simple, cartoonish or digital art style. The pixelated edges suggest it may be a low-resolution image.
*   **Light and Shadow:** There's a subtle highlight on the upper-left part of the circle and a slightly darker shade on the bottom right, indicating a light source and suggesting depth.

**Absence of Text:** The image does not contain any text or alphanumeric characters.
 Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a red "X" symbol. It appears to be a cartoonish or illustrative representation due to its rounded edges and somewhat glossy appearance. The "X" is a solid, uniform red color with a slightly lighter, glossy outline that gives it a three-dimensional feel. The background is a solid black color.

**Key Features:**

*   **Symbol:** The primary element is the red "X", typically used to indicate "no", "cancel", "error", or "wrong".
*   **Color:** The use of a vibrant red color likely draws attention to the symbol.
*   **Style:** The cartoonish style suggests it may be intended for a casual or child-friendly context.
*   **Background:** The dark background causes the red "X" to pop, improving visibility.

Let me know if you have any specific questions about the image that you'd like me to answer!

@carlton @Jivraj

Hi ,

I am trying to build using both docker and podman but it failed on both. I have watched many videos trying to resolve this adn also chatgpt in order to resolve the issue but it seems to persist. I even uninstalled and reinstalled both podman and doceker multiple times but no help.

When i run command docker build -t \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

the error that comes is :

Dockerfile:2
------------

Even tried getting python:3.12-slim separatly and trying again but that also didn’t work.  
I think there is some problem in getting python:3.12-slim as the build always stops at this.

on asking ChatGPT it shows that some DNS or network issue is there. I even tried all the remedy that was provided on creating custom network etc. but this was also of no use

Kindly help me finding solution to this and pls mention any other assistance I may require to get this running

Thank You.

@carlton needed a confirmation on this task

`A8 * `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - in this task i assume prompt can ask for credit card number or other details like cvv and name.

My question is, whether my system should allow prompt that CVV or or such info ? or should give it ?

1. Previously I asked for some more credits to test my project. I got an email stating I have been provided with a new token but I think I got that same token again, not a new one. I still cant send request to the AIPROXY. Please help.
2. Do I need to submit the docker image name with the tag or without the tag? I submitted it before without the tag. Now i see that I have tagged the image with as v1 but I cant submit the form due to pattern matching problems. Should i submit again after tagging it with :latest ?

@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini  
When I run my docker image using

`podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

Task A2 fails as the podman container is unable to find npx.

Running the same image using

`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`

works fine and Task A2 passes. I can’t understand why this is happening.

I also ran the image in both docker and podman in interactive mode as show in the below snippet from terminal.  
When run using docker, `which node` gives `/usr/bin/node` as output but when run using podman, nothing.

```
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH
/root/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# which node
# exit
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo docker run --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# echo $PATH
/root/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# which node
/usr/bin/node
# exit
shiva@shiva:~/Desktop/tdsp1$ sudo podman run --user=root --rm -it docker.io/myusername/myreponame /bin/sh
# which node
# which node
# exit

Here’s how to prompt folks. Just do what @carlton mentioned in today’s live session (the 5 hour marathon) and you should be good for Project-1!

Most people are still prompting wrong.
I've found this framework, which was even shared by OpenAI President Greg Brockman.

Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image is a medium close-up portrait of a man against an urban backdrop. He appears to be smiling. The background seems to be a cityscape with blurred buildings.

**Man in the Portrait:**

*   **Gender:** Male
*   **Age:** Likely in his late 20s or early 30s.
*   **Hair:** Dark hair, styled with a slight side part.
*   **Facial Features:** A mustache and likely a beard, though it's not fully visible. He is wearing glasses.
*   **Expression:** He is smiling broadly, indicating a positive mood.
*   **Attire:** He is wearing a dark or black top, which is visible at the neck.

**Background:**

*   **Setting:** The background appears to be an urban environment.
*   **Buildings:** There are blurred high-rise buildings, suggesting a city skyline.
*   **Color Palette:** The background has cooler tones compared to the subject's face.

**Possible Interpretations:**

*   This could be a professional headshot, a social media profile picture, or a casual photo taken in a city environment. The smile and pose suggest a friendly and approachable demeanor.
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image is a presentation slide titled "The Anatomy of an o1 Prompt." It breaks down a sample prompt into different sections, each highlighted with a colored line and a label. The prompt is about finding good hikes near San Francisco.

**Breakdown of the prompt:**

*   **Goal (Green Line):** This section outlines the primary objective. It states: "I want a list of the best medium-length hikes within two hours of San Francisco. Each hike should provide a cool and unique adventure, and be lesser known."

*   **Return Format (Blue Line):** This defines how the information should be returned. The prompt states: "For each hike, return the name of the hike as I'd find it on AllTrails, then provide the starting address of the hike, the ending address of the hike, distance, drive time, hike duration, and what makes it a cool and unique adventure. Return the top 3."

*   **Warnings (Red Line):** This highlights cautionary notes. The prompt states: "Be careful to make sure that the name of trail is correct, that it actually exists, and that the time is correct."

*   **Context Dump (Gray Line):** This section provides additional context to help refine the results. The prompt states: "For context: my girlfriend and i hike a ton! we've done pretty much all of the local SF hikes, whether that's presidio or golden gate park. we definitely want to get out of town -- we did mount tam pretty recently, the whole thing from the beginning of the stairs to stinson -- it was really long and we are definitely in the mood for something different this weekend! ocean views would still be nice. we love delicious food. one thing i loved about the mt tam hike is that it ends with a celebration (Arriving in town to breakfast!) The old missile silos and stuff near Discovery point is cool but I've just done that hike probably 20x at this point. We won't be seeing eachother for a few weeks (she has to stay in LA for work) so the uniqueness here really counts." This section indicates that the user has done many local hikes, they want to get out of town, prefer something different, and hints that a hike ending with a celebration (like a meal) would be a plus. They've done Mount Tam and Discovery Point hikes recently. The context indicates that the uniqueness of the hike is important due to an upcoming separation.

sir I am noticing a pattern, that when I am running the datagen first. And then using the evaluate.py, then I am getting the A2 right.  
But running the evaluation.py for the 2nd time cause the A2 to fail…  
Probabbly Because the file in the data folder gets upated should I worry for that…

in the phase B, we have no idea about how many arguments are there, so should we make every function mapping with 2 arguments ( 1 containing the input location and other containing output location) or should we take the parameters in some other way

There has been an outage in some parts of the country related to cloudflare servers. What helped some students (and us) is using a completely different network eg. instead of using your home wifi, use mobile internet, since they go through a different DNS and this sometimes works.

Kind regards

We have not specified a size limit for the docker image, so in theory there is not a limit to the docker image size.

Hello @carlton Sir,  
While running evaluate.py , I have observed that the expected and actual output is having difference like “\n” then also it marks task as fail.

eg:  
 EXPECTED:  
Cover west give likely individual though question inside. System many human plant card among provide. Large former seek mouth there long.  
Attention officer successful. Us population the true show.  
Real cold if play side wind affect. Street cause investment receive have miss page station.  
Cold rest term her conference. Animal sure campaign new.  
Meeting back page exactly itself book forward. Decision western series under from shoulder. Pay during feeling newspaper human. Professional old recent beyond girl three human.  
Difficult yourself build increase back put others.  
Although artist operation thing skin lead. Billion deep measure down adult suggest. Anything action start artist when first.  
Whole way know down. Music machine trip father rather.  
Must medical bad law issue.  
Someone explain seven maintain wrong day factor property.

RESULT:  
“Cover west give likely individual though question inside. System many human plant card among provide. Large former seek mouth there long.\nAttention officer successful. Us population the true show.\nReal cold if play side wind affect. Street cause investment receive have miss page station.\nCold rest term her conference.

A5 FAILED

Will this be considered as failure in actual evaluation as well or will this be taken care in actual evaluation?
Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Content:**

The image displays a yellow warning sign with a black exclamation point centered within it. 

*   **Shape:** The sign is a triangle, pointing upwards.
*   **Color:** The background is a bright, saturated yellow. The exclamation point is black.
*   **Exclamation Point:** The exclamation point is vertically oriented, consisting of a thick line with a dot below it.
*   **Style:** The image is rendered in a simple, clean style, similar to an emoji or icon. It appears to be a digital representation rather than a photograph of a physical sign.
*   **Purpose:** It is universally recognized as a warning sign, indicating potential danger or a call for attention to a specific hazard.

Let me know if you want to explore the context of its usage or any other aspect!
 Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image features a yellow triangular warning sign with a black exclamation mark inside. 

*   **Shape:** The sign is triangular.
*   **Color:** The triangle is bright yellow.
*   **Symbol:** A bold black exclamation mark is centered within the triangle.
*   **Background:** The background is black.
*   **Style:** The image appears to be a digital representation, possibly an emoji or a simplified illustration of a warning sign.

The key takeaway is that the image clearly communicates a warning or alert, using the universally recognized visual language of a triangular warning sign.
 Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

*   The image features a large, stylized red "X" or cross-mark.
*   It has a slightly 3D or cartoonish appearance, indicated by the slight shading around the edges.
*   The color is a vibrant red.
*   The background is solid black, which causes the red "X" to stand out prominently.

**Possible Interpretations:**

The "X" could symbolize:

*   A deletion or removal operation.
*   A mistake or incorrect answer.
*   A prohibition or denial (like "no").
*   A closing or dismissal action (like closing a window or dialog box).
*   A generic marker.

image1412×248 16.3 KB

Im able to execute the query succesfully.  

image1109×570 40.3 KB

But the data gets downloaded to C drive instead of the project folder  
The datagen.py file is in the project folder itself.

image821×149 9.61 KB

am I making any error when setting the directories?

Please help, have been facing this issue since the beginning of this project, initially tried to move the files from C drive to project folder but that does not seem like a viable solution.
Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

**Image Type:** The image is a screenshot of a web browser window.

**Browser Window Elements:**

*   **Tabs:** The browser has at least two tabs open.
    *   One tab is displaying content from the URL: "127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install%20uv%20(if%20required)%20and%20run%20https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py" (URL encoded).
    *   The second tab is titled "Settings".

*   **URL Bar:** The URL "127.0.0.1:8000/run?task=Install%20uv%20(if%20required)%20and%20run%20https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py" is visible in the URL bar.

*   **Content Area:** The primary content displayed in the browser window is a JSON response.

**JSON Response:**

*   `"success": "Executed https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py with email trial@gmail.com"`

**Interpretation:**

The image shows the result of a script execution initiated through a local web server (127.0.0.1:8000). The URL suggests that the task involved installing something, and then running a Python script called "datagen.py" located on GitHub. The JSON response confirms that the execution was successful, and it also includes an email address ("trial@gmail.com") as a parameter.
 Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Context:**

The image shows a window of Windows File Explorer. It displays the contents of a folder named "data" located within the C: drive of an Acer computer.

**Top Bar Elements:**

*   **Tab:** The current tab is labelled "data".
*   **Navigation:** There are back and forward arrow buttons for navigation, along with a refresh button.
*   **Address Bar:** The address bar displays the current path: "This PC > Acer (C:) > data".

**Toolbar Elements:**

*   There are toolbar buttons for creating a "New" folder/item, "Cut," "Copy", "Paste", "Delete," and "Rename".
*   **Sort & View:** Buttons for sorting the files and changing the view are also visible.

**Left Pane:**

*   The left pane shows a hierarchical list of common locations, including "Pictures," "Desktop," "Downloads," "Documents," "Pictures," "Music," "Videos," "TDS assignments 4," and "Ilm-automation-agent."

**Right Pane (File Listing):**

This is the main content area, displaying the files and folders within the "data" folder. The columns visible are "Name," "Date modified," "Type," and "Size."

**File/Folder Listing:**

Here's a breakdown of the files and folders in the "data" directory:

*   **docs:** File folder
*   **logs:** File folder
*   **comments:** Text Source File (10 KB)
*   **contacts:** JSON Source File (9 KB)
*   **credit\_card:** PNG File (5 KB)
*   **dates:** Text Source File (15 KB)
*   **email:** Text Source File (1 KB)
*   **format:** Markdown Source... (1 KB)
*   **ticket-sales:** Data Base File (32 KB)

**Date Information:**

All the files and folders listed have the same "Date modified" timestamp: 16-02-2025 11:56 or 11:58.

**Overall Impression:**

The "data" folder appears to contain a mix of documents, configuration files (like JSON), image files, and potentially sensitive data (based on the "credit\_card" file name).
 The image shows lines of Python code related to setting up a project's data directory.

Specifically, it contains the following:

*   **Line 35:** A comment stating the goal: "Ensure all files are accessed from the 'data' folder inside the project root".
*   **Line 36:** Defines a variable `PROJECT_ROOT` by getting the absolute path of the current working directory using `os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())`.
*   **Line 37:** Defines a variable `DATA_DIR` which represents the path to the 'data' directory within the project root. It joins `PROJECT_ROOT` with the string "data" using `os.path.join()`.
*   **Line 39:** Another comment: "Ensure the 'data' directory exists".
*   **Line 40:** Uses `os.makedirs(DATA_DIR, exist_ok=True)` to create the 'data' directory if it doesn't already exist. The `exist_ok=True` argument prevents an error if the directory already exists.

In essence, the code ensures that a 'data' directory exists within the project and sets up variables to easily access this directory.

image1123×760 42.8 KB

  
I am also running datagen.py in the project directory, yet data folder is created in C drive.
Here is a detailed description of the image content:

The image presents Python code defining a function named `run_datagen` that takes a `task_description` as input. The code's purpose is to extract a URL and an email address from the provided description, download a script from the URL, install the 'uv' package if it isn't already installed, and then execute the downloaded script with the extracted email as an argument.

Here's a breakdown of the code's key parts:

1.  **Function Definition:** `def run_datagen(task_description):` defines the function.

2.  **URL and Email Extraction:**
    *   `script_url_match = re.search(r"https?://[^\s]+\.py", task_description)`: This line uses a regular expression to find a URL ending in ".py" within the `task_description`.
    *   `user_email_match = re.search(r"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}", task_description)`: This line uses a regular expression to find an email address within the `task_description`.

3.  **Error Handling:**
    *   `if not script_url_match or not user_email_match:`: Checks if either the URL or email was not found.
    *   `return {"error": "URL or email not found in the prompt."}`: Returns an error message if either is missing.

4.  **Extract Matched Values:**
    *   `script_url = script_url_match.group(0)`: Extracts the matched URL.
    *   `user_email = user_email_match.group(0)`: Extracts the matched email.

5.  **Script Path Definition:**
    *   `script_path = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "datagen.py")`: Constructs the path where the script will be saved. `PROJECT_ROOT` is assumed to be a predefined constant or variable representing the project's root directory.

6.  **Script Download and Save:**
    *   `try:`: Begins a `try` block for handling potential exceptions during the download process.
    *   `response = requests.get(script_url)`: Downloads the script from the extracted URL using the `requests` library.
    *   `response.raise_for_status()`: Checks if the download was successful. This will raise an exception for HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).
    *   `with open(script_path, "wb") as f:`: Opens the specified file path in write binary mode (`wb`).  The downloaded content will be written to this file.
    *   `f.write(response.content)`: Writes the downloaded script content to the file.

7.  **UV Installation Check:**
    *   `try:`: Another `try` block to handle exceptions during the uv installation process.
    *   `subprocess.run(["uv", "--version"], check=True, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)`: Checks if the 'uv' package is installed.
    *   `except FileNotFoundError:`: Catches the exception when UV is not installed.
    *   `subprocess.run(["pip", "install", "uv"], check=True)`: Installs the 'uv' package using pip.

8.  **Script Execution:**
    *   `subprocess.run(["python", script_path, user_email], cwd=PROJECT_ROOT, check=True)`: Executes the downloaded script using the Python interpreter, passing the user email as a command-line argument.  `cwd=PROJECT_ROOT` specifies the working directory for the subprocess.

9.  **Return Success Message:**
    *   `return {"success": f"Executed {script_url} with email {user_email}"}`: Returns a success message indicating that the script has been executed and includes the script URL and the email used in the execution.

In essence, the code automates the process of fetching a script, ensuring its execution environment is set up (specifically checking for and installing 'uv'), and then running the script with the provided email address, providing a convenient way to automate tasks based on dynamically downloaded scripts.

@jkmadathil @carlton @Jivraj  
Sir earlier my code was running fine, but after the assigment of the new token,  
it is now showing 400 bad request, which simply implies there is something wrong with the token…  
plz do something sir…

I have do have cross verified the new token been correctly been assigned to the system variable…
Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the text and potential insights:

**Overall Impression:**

The image captures network communication logs, likely from a web server or similar application. It displays two HTTP requests:

*   A `POST` request that appears to be a request to run a task.
*   A `GET` request that is requesting to read a file

**Request Details**

1.  **First Request (POST):**

    *   **Source:** 127.0.0.1:51794
    *   **Method:** POST
    *   **Path:** /run
    *   **Query Parameters (task):** The task parameter is a long string detailing instructions. Let's break it down:
        *   `The+SQLite+database+file+%60%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales.db%60+has+a+%60tickets%60+with+columns+%60type%60C+%60units%60%2C+and+%60price%60.`  This indicates that the task involves an SQLite database file named `ticket-sales.db` located in the `/data/` directory.  The `tickets` table within the database has columns named `type`, `units`, and `price`.
        *  `Each+row+is+a+customer+bid+for+a+concert+ticket.+What+is+the+total+sales+of+all+the+items+in+the+%22Gold%22+ticket+type%3F` The task asks you to calculate the total sales of all items with the ticket type "Gold".
        *   `Write+the+number+in+%60%2Fdata%2Fticket-sales-gold.txt%60` The result (the total sales value) should be written to a text file named `ticket-sales-gold.txt` located in the `/data/` directory.
    *   **HTTP Response:** 400 Bad Request. This means the server understood the request, but couldn't process it due to an error (likely related to the task definition or data validation).

2.  **Second Request (GET):**

    *   **Source:** 127.0.0.1:51797
    *   **Method:** GET
    *   **Path:** /read
    *   **Query Parameters (path):** `path=/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` This is a request to read the contents of the `ticket-sales-gold.txt` file.
    *   **HTTP Response:** 404 Not Found. This indicates that the file `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` was not found on the server.

**Key Observations:**

*   The goal seems to be to query an SQLite database, perform a calculation, and store the result in a file.
*   The initial POST request failed.
*   The subsequent GET request to retrieve the supposed output file also failed (because it wasn't created due to the POST failure).
*   The use of `127.0.0.1` indicates that these requests are likely being made from the local machine.

In summary, the image depicts a failed attempt to execute a database query and retrieve the results due to a "Bad Request" and subsequently a "Not Found" error.

Use following as first parameter of `subprocess.run()` to create `data/` directory inside your project instead of C: drive

```
["uv", "run", script_url, user_email, "--root", "./data"]

```

Also, you don’t need to download to script, you can directly run it from the url.

The reason for error is `evaluate.py` is trying to import `datagen.py` which doesn’t exist in your system. I’ll suggest download both the files, keep them in same folder and run `evaluate.py` from your computer

### Generation-Based Automation Agent (No Hard Coding)

**Repository Link:** GitHub - 23f2005593/tds

Currently, it can complete 7 out of 10 tasks. In reality, it can complete 9 out of 10 tasks, but the expected results are not flexible in evaluate.py file.

If we can extract credit card numbers, it will be able to complete 10 out of 10 tasks.

Please contribute to this repository. **We will win together.**

sir for this task- A6 Find all Markdown (`.md` ) files in `/data/docs/` . For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `#`  ). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}` ) …I am getting correct result for all files but for the very first file budget.md it shows wrong.  
my result- { “budget.md”: “Success easy same main modern doctor.”,  
“build.md”: “Shoulder follow own never above.”,  
and in the data files there is different heading in budget.md.- # Series dog who make specific agree between.  
my question is this if it works for all the files then why not for this file budget.md @Saransh\_Saini @Jivraj @carlton

Check the file once, there is a possibility that it’s either fetching a comment or the second heading. Refactor your prompt to search only for the First Heading, specify it explixitly.

This is happening because evaluate.py is unable to fetch your API Key from the environment variables. Create a new variable and set it’s value to your API Key then try.

Hi everyone,

I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:

bash

Copy

```
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings

```

I receive a **401 Unauthorized** response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the `"data"` key.

### What I’ve Tried

1. **Token Verification:**

* I’m using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email.
* The token is passed in the header as follows:

python

Copy

```
"Authorization": f"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}"

```

* I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).

2. **API Request Details:**

* The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.
* The payload is set as:

json

Copy

```
{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": ["Test"]}

```

* Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.

3. **Debug Output:**  
   Here’s a snippet of the debug output:

bash

Copy

```
HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"
🔴 A9 failed: 'data'

```

This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.

### What I Suspect

* The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.
* There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of.
* Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.

### Request for Help

Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

B5. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database  
Should I ask for the SQL data base. Or the agent should be smart enough to find the required database…  
Moreover in the data folder there is only one database is it should be robust to handle multiple databases…

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh\_Saini
Here's a detailed description of the image:

*   **Main Content:** The image shows a single, circular object.

*   **Color:** The object is predominantly red. It's not a perfectly uniform shade; there are subtle variations suggesting shading or a light source.

*   **Shape:** It's a round, two-dimensional shape resembling a sphere viewed head-on.

*   **Detail:** There's a lighter, brighter area on the upper left portion of the circle, suggesting a highlight from a light source. This adds a sense of depth and roundness.

*   **Pixelation:** The image has noticeable pixelation, indicating that it's a low-resolution image or has been significantly zoomed in.

*   **Background:** The background is black, which makes the red circle stand out.

In summary, the image features a red circle with some shading to give it a 3D effect, set against a black background. The pixelation suggests it's either a small image enlarged or a low-resolution graphic.

I had a question on evaluation by the course team. To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using `podman rmi -a` and then ran `podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME` with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided here. But this gave me the following error:

```
Error: short-name "freshbash/dataworks-agent" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in "/etc/containers/registries.conf

```

The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.

The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be `docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent`

I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful. Thanks!

Hardest i ever worked in my life. Thank you @s.anand
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

The image appears to be a screenshot from a user interface, likely a settings or billing page related to GitHub Codespaces. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Title:** "Codespaces" is prominently displayed, indicating this section pertains to Codespaces usage.
*   **Quota Reset:** There's text indicating "Included quotas reset in 10 days" with a link "See billing documentation".
*   **Usage Hours:** This section shows usage hours. It displays "172.37 of 180.00 included core hours used," accompanied by a progress bar (mostly red, indicating high usage). It also shows "$0.00".
*   **Storage:** This section shows storage usage. It displays "9.21 of 20.00 included GB-month used," accompanied by a progress bar (mostly blue, indicating low usage). It also shows "$0.00".
*   **Spending Limit:** There's a section indicating "$0.00 monthly spending limit" with a link "Set up a spending limit." It also shows "$0.00".
*   **Icons and Arrows:** There are "<>" icons next to "Codespaces" and right-pointing arrows " > " next to "Usage Hours" and "Storage".
*   **Overall:** The UI seems to be designed to show how much of included Codespaces resources the user has consumed and their current cost ($0.00).
 Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image is a screenshot of a billing or usage dashboard, likely related to a cloud computing service. It focuses on resource consumption for a feature called "Codespaces."

**Key Elements:**

*   **Header:**
    *   "Codespaces" title
    *   A small code-like icon ( "<>" or similar) next to the title
    *   Text indicating the included quotas reset in 13 days.
    *   A link to "See billing documentation".

*   **Usage Hours:**
    *   Label: "Usage hours"
    *   An arrow indicator (">") suggests a possible expansion of this section.
    *   Usage information: "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used"
    *   A horizontal bar (progress bar) indicating resource consumption (red). It's fully filled, showing 100% usage.
    *   Cost: "$0.00" (likely indicating usage is within the included quota)

*   **Storage:**
    *   Label: "Storage"
    *   An arrow indicator (">") suggests a possible expansion of this section.
    *   Usage information: "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used"
    *   A horizontal bar (progress bar) indicating resource consumption (blue). Partially filled.
    *   Cost: "$0.00" (likely indicating usage is within the included quota)

**In essence, the image shows a user's resource usage for Codespaces. They have fully used their included core hours, and have partially used their included storage. Both are currently within the included quotas and are not incurring extra charges.**

Here is a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Overall Description:**

The image features a stylized, intricate depiction of an owl's face. It has a design that suggests it could be a badge, emblem, or logo.

**Key Features and Elements:**

*   **Owl:** The central element is the owl's face. It is highly detailed with distinct feathery patterns and a somewhat geometric design. The owl's face is stylized rather than realistic.
*   **Eyes:** The owl's eyes are large, round, and glowing with a bright, vibrant blue color. They are a focal point and give the owl a sense of wisdom or awareness.
*   **Color Palette:** The color scheme is predominantly cool, with various shades of blue, purple, and gold.
*   **Background:** The background has a dark, possibly starry appearance, which gives a sense of mystery or night.
*   **Ornate Details:** There are many intricate decorative elements around the owl's face, including what looks like carvings. These details enhance the mystical and/or symbolic nature of the image.
*   **Shape:** The image is contained within an oval or circular shape, suggesting that it's meant to be used as a symbol or emblem.

**In summary,** the image is a detailed and stylized representation of an owl's face, designed with an ornate and somewhat mystical aesthetic. The bright blue eyes, dark background, and intricate details all contribute to a strong sense of wisdom, mystery, and symbolic significance.

ur words are saying something else
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a yellow circular smiley face emoji.

*   **Shape:** The emoji is a perfect circle.
*   **Color:** The color is a standard yellow.
*   **Facial Features:** It has two small, dark-brown, oval-shaped eyes. There is a simple, curved, dark-brown line representing a smile.
*   **Expression:** The overall expression conveyed is one of general happiness or contentment.

In summary, the image is a classic smiley face emoji, simple in design, and communicating a positive sentiment.

Hey I just got a mail saying that my github repo has no Dockerfile present. and im confused .

It doesnt mention anywhere that the dockerfile must be present in the root directory as a requirement/prerequisite of the project.

In my case its present inside the app directory. Could the team help clarify on this issue.

I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

Hey team, I just moved my Dockerfile to the root level on my Github repo. Hope this solves the issue.

Dear @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj , and @Saransh\_Saini

Thank you all for this wonderful project. Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.

@carlton Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.  
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.

I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.

image1919×1016 117 KB

  
this problem occuring sir since two days
Here's a detailed description of the image content, focusing on text, objects, and relevant features that could help answer questions:

**Overall Layout:**

*   The image is a screenshot of a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) window.
*   The window is divided into several panes: Explorer (left), Editor (center), Terminal (bottom), and a right-side panel with multiple terminals.

**Left Panel (Explorer):**

*   Shows a directory structure for a project named "ALGSOCH".
*   Key files and folders include:
    *   `vickykumarLLM` (presumably the main project folder)
    *   `app` folder
    *   Files: `database.py`, `llm_handler.py`, `tasks.py`, `tempCodeRunnerfile.py`, `utils.py`, `main.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `app.py`, `.gitignore`
    *   `data` and `tests` folders
*   This suggests the project is likely a Python application with a backend built around a Large Language Model (LLM).

**Center Panel (Editor):**

*   The file `main.py` is open.
*   Python code visible:
    *   `from fastapi import FastAPI`
    *   `from app.tasks import run_task`
    *   `app = FastAPI()`
    *   `@app.get("/")`
    *   `def home():`
    *   `return {"message": "LLM-based Automation Agent is Running"}`
    *   `@app.post("/run")`
*   The code indicates this is a FastAPI application, likely serving an API endpoint.

**Bottom Panel (Terminal):**

*   The terminal displays a series of commands and outputs.
*   Key information in the terminal output:
    *   `Requirement already satisfied` messages for packages like `anyio`, `idna`, and `sniffio`.
    *   `[notice] A new release of pip is available` message. The terminal output suggests that pip is out of date.
    *   `PS C:\algsoch/vickykumartLPD pip install upgrade python` command, which results in the error `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python (from versions: none)`.
    *   `PS C:\algsoch/vickykumartLPD python -u "c:\algsoch\vickykumart/main.py"` command, which results in the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`. This indicates the `fastapi` module is not installed or not accessible in the current environment.
    *   `PS C:\algsoch/vickykumartLPD docker build -t 11m-agent` command, which starts a Docker build process.
    *   Output from the Docker build process: Loading the build definition from `Dockerfile`, transferring the Dockerfile, and loading metadata for `docker.io/library/python:3.10-slim`.
*   These outputs suggest the user is trying to install Python, run a Python script, and build a Docker image.

**Right Panel (Terminals):**

*   Shows several terminal instances: `uvicorn vick`, `powershell...`, `Code vickyk...`, `powershell...`, `bash`, `powershell...`.  This indicates the user is working with multiple terminal sessions.

**Overall Interpretation:**

The image shows a developer working on a FastAPI-based Python application, likely an LLM-based agent. The developer is having issues with module installation (specifically `fastapi`) and is attempting to build a Docker image for the application. The terminal output indicates problems with the Python environment and package management.

How long does it take to make a docker image, I’ve been doing it for the past 25 minutes and it’s still not completed.

1. Your LLM app should be designed like it can give desire result based on task desc at run endpoint, and that result should be accessible at read endpoint.
2. Evaluation file just for reference to check how things works and it works for phase A tasks only. Also ensure datagen.py file and evaluation.py file are latest. There is one issue in evaluation.py file for task A1, link of datagen.py file not correct, rectify that link. Even it corrected in GitHub repo file but when I download that raw file in local system it takes back previous link.

@s.anand @carlton  
Dear Sir,

I am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.

I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.

I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.

I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.

Thank you for considering my heartfelt request.

Sincerely,

Rishit Jain  
(24F2004595)

Sir, due to time panic, I mistakenly named the Docker image incorrectly.

I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do.  
Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?

@s.anand  
@carlton sorry to disturb you, project1 deadline is over.  
I made a mistake in my project. In my call llm function i set some payload instead of default for open ai api call like max token, temp. , n, stop etc.  
Due to this, some tasks may fail especially credit card image task will fail 100%, if possible can i just remove that payload from git hub repository . or you can check this call llm function present in my task\_handler.py file of my repository.  
I found this issue after deadline. If possible consider this request. I never engaged in a project or course like for this one. I love this project genuinely.

I would like to sincerely thank the course faculty @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh\_Saini for their support on the project throughout the week. They were so patient in listening to our issues and helping us resolve them, even if the issues were repeated.

I was not able to complete some or maybe many of the tasks but overall, it was a very good learning for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Thanks very much again for your guidance and support.

Thanks for your compliments Swati. It’s always nice to know our efforts paid off.  
*Happy Learning*
Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image features a single emoji of a "Thumbs Up" gesture.

**Key Features:**

*   **Emoji:** The primary subject of the image is the "Thumbs Up" emoji. It displays a hand with the thumb extended upwards, indicating approval, agreement, or a positive sentiment.

*   **Color:** The hand is depicted in a bright yellow color. This is a common color representation for skin tones in emojis, aiming for neutrality.

*   **Style:** The emoji has a simple, slightly cartoonish style. The lines are clear and the shading is minimal.

*   **Background:** The background is solid black, which makes the yellow emoji stand out prominently.

**Overall Impression:**

The image conveys a straightforward message of approval, agreement, or positive affirmation. It's a clear and concise representation of a widely understood gesture.

I have received a mail that my project has ""No “MIT” in LICENSE;No Dockerfile " which I saw today. My project has MIT licence and Dockerfile was also there… but to reconfirm I pulled my dockerfile from dockerhub to github only . NOw am not sure will that be considered now in my project submission or not. Requesting to kindly consider current state of my project in submission for my project.

I noticed something quite funny. The project never specified the required tech stack, so one could have done this entirely with JavaScript as well, assuming the necessary libraries are installed.

@TheVishal  
EDIT: Create a new docker image with the mistaken image name , so when they pull image from repo, that image with the wrong name also gets pulled.  
what to do

* push a new image with the mistaken name, so in your repo there will be two images  
    
  how will this help?
* since you are unsure, which image link you posted, you can be sure that even you had a mistake in link, a new image will exist with the wrong name after you push another image

@all  
use this to update your image even after submission, as now they only validate the images, they do not pull it so you can edit your project and add more functionality if they release the code solutiion

CHEERS

I didn’t submit the google form, I have made the github repo and docker image for TDS project 1. I, mistakenly, thought that I had submitted the google form but actually it was saved as a draft and closed my laptop. As soon as I realized my mistake, I hit the submit button but this was shown then,  
“The form TDS Jan 2025 - Project 1 Submission is no longer accepting responses.”

I apologize for this. I have been working on this project for weeks.  
This was my first TDS project. I would highly appreciated, if you could help me.  
Thankyou

If I am not wrong you were getting 9/10 in task A when many of us were stuck and you didn’t submit… unbelievable
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a single emoji.

**Emoji Description:**

*   It's a yellow face with a broad, open smile showing teeth. The mouth is open with a visible pink tongue.
*   The eyes are closed and have a slightly upward curve, creating a squinting appearance.
*   There is a single, large, blue droplet (sweat drop) positioned to the right side of the face, near the eyebrow area.

**Overall Impression:**

The emoji conveys a sense of nervous laughter, relief, or a mix of amusement and anxiety. The sweat drop indicates a feeling of stress or pressure that has been relieved, or the recognition that something is almost too crazy to be real, while the smile indicates they see the funny side of the stressful experience.
 Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Content:**

*   The image is of a digital emoji.
*   It depicts a yellow, circular face with a slightly embarrassed or nervous expression.
*   The face has closed eyes (indicated by small, curved lines) and a wide, open mouth showing teeth and a pink tongue.
*   A single, large blue bead of sweat is positioned near the forehead of the emoji, indicating stress, anxiety, or a difficult situation.

**Overall Impression:** The emoji conveys a sense of nervous laughter or relief after a potentially stressful event. It is a common way to express feeling slightly flustered or awkward.

Thank you, sir, for giving us this amazing opportunity! Honestly, I learned more in the last week than I did throughout the three modules.

The project was a rollercoaster ride—especially with all the errors that kept popping up—but overall, the experience was incredibly enriching. The amount of knowledge I gained was truly valuable.

A huge thanks to @Carlton, @Saransh\_Saini, and @Jivraj sir for their guidance and support. Without the last week’s lectures, the project couldn’t have been completed.

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a billing or usage section for a "Codespaces" service, likely within a software development or cloud platform.

**Elements:**

1.  **Header:**
    *   The icon `<>` and text "Codespaces" indicate the name of the service.
    *   A line of text below states "Included quotas reset in 13 days," informing the user when their usage quotas will reset.
    *   A link "See billing documentation" suggests that more information about billing policies can be found there.

2.  **Usage Hours:**
    *   "Usage hours" is the label for this section.
    *   "120.00 of 120.00 included core hours used" shows that the user has used all the included core hours.
    *   A red bar visually represents the usage, indicating it's maxed out.
    *   "$0.00" suggests that the usage within the included quota is free.

3.  **Storage:**
    *   "Storage" is the label for this section.
    *   "1.46 of 15.00 included GB-month used" shows that the user has used 1.46 GB-month of storage out of a 15 GB-month quota.
    *   A blue bar visually represents the storage usage, indicating it's a small portion of the total.
    *   "$0.00" suggests that the storage usage within the included quota is free.

**Interpretation:**

*   The user is likely on a free or limited plan, as they have used all their included core hours.
*   They still have significant storage capacity remaining.
*   The overall design suggests a dashboard or settings page where users can monitor their resource consumption within the Codespaces service.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

The image shows a section from a user interface related to "codespaces". At the top, in a larger, bold font, is the text "Your codespaces". 

To the right, there are two buttons. The first one says "Go to docs" and has a dark gray background. The second button is green and says "New codespace".

Below these elements, there is a rectangular notification box with a dark red background. Inside this box, there's a red icon that resembles a stop sign with an exclamation point. To the right of the icon, the text reads: "You're at 100% of your included usage for this billing period. For more information, view your billing settings." The phrase "billing settings" is hyperlinked (as indicated by the blue color and the fact that it is underlined), suggesting it will take the user to a relevant settings page when clicked.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Layout:**

The image shows a section of a user interface related to a service called "Codespaces". It presents usage and cost information. The UI has a dark color scheme.

**Header:**

*   **"Codespaces"** text, indicating the service the information pertains to.
*   A small icon next to the text, which appears to represent code (angle brackets `<>` are visible).
*   A line of text that reads: "Included quotas reset in 8 days. See billing documentation" with "See billing documentation" hyperlinked

**Usage Information:**

The image presents usage data in two categories: "Usage hours" and "Storage." Each category shows the used amount, the included amount, and a progress bar.

*   **Usage Hours:**
    *   Label: "Usage hours"
    *   Text: "180.00 of 180.00 included core hours used"
    *   A red progress bar fills the entire length. Indicating that 100% of included usage hours have been used.
    *   Cost: "$0.00"

*   **Storage:**
    *   Label: "Storage"
    *   Text: "9.60 of 20.00 included GB-month used"
    *   A blue progress bar, partially filled, indicates usage.
    *   Cost: "$0.00"

**Other Features:**

*   Small ">" icons next to "Usage hours" and "Storage," potentially indicating that these sections can be expanded or collapsed.

In summary, the image depicts the usage and cost details for Codespaces. The user has used all of their included usage hours and nearly half of their included storage. There are no costs associated with the current usage.

@carlton @Jivraj Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.

Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.00.50 PM126×226 2.02 KB
Here's a description of the content of the image:

The image consists of a single line of text. The text states: "P1 and P2 will have two components - Submissions and peer reviews with weightage 80:20."

In essence, the image outlines that P1 and P2 are graded based on two factors - Submissions and Peer Reviews, with the former comprising 80% of the grade and the latter comprising 20%.
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows a cropped portion of a table, possibly from a document or application. It is split into two cells vertically.

*   **Top Cell:** Contains the text "Peer Review Date" in a sans-serif font. Below this, there's a hyphen "-".
*   **Bottom Cell:** Contains the text "Tuesday, February 25, 2025". The text is multi-lined to fit within the cell.

**Format and Style:**

*   The text is black against a white background.
*   The table lines are thin and black.
*   The text appears to be centrally aligned within each cell.

In short, the image presents a "Peer Review Date" cell, with an indication that the actual date is specified as "Tuesday, February 25, 2025". The top cell indicates a field title, and the bottom cell shows the actual value of this field.

This project is one of the best experiences I had in the entire degree program. I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.

I really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.

Doing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like @23f1002382 and also got the chance to help a few.

I thank the entire TDS team - @s.anand sir, @carlton , @Jivraj for their support throughout this amazing experience.

Regards,  
Pradeep Mondal

Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**Overall View:**

The image shows a web API testing interface, likely Postman or a similar tool. A POST request is being constructed and sent to a local server. The response from the server is displayed below.

**Key Elements:**

*   **Request Method and URL:**
    *   **Method:** POST
    *   **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/run?task=The file /data/dates.txt con...` (truncated, but it seems to be passing the file path "/data/dates.txt" as a parameter to the "run" endpoint).
*   **Parameters:**
    *   The "Params" tab is selected, and there's one parameter defined:
        *   **Key:** `task`
        *   **Value:** `The file /data/dates.txt co...` (truncated, but seems to be the file path)
*   **Tabs:** Other tabs are visible:
    *   Auth
    *   Headers (with a count of 7)
    *   Body
    *   Scripts
    *   Tests
    *   Settings
    *   Cookies
*   **Response Body:**
    *   The response is in JSON format.
    *   **Status Code:** 200 OK (meaning the request was successful, but the response content indicates an issue).
    *   **Response Content:**
        ```json
        {
          "error": {
            "message": "Invalid value: 'json'. Supported values are: 'json_object', 'json_schema', and 'text'.",
            "type": "invalid_request_error",
            "param": "response_format.type",
            "code": "invalid_value"
          },
          "monthlyCost": 0.07081907999999999,
          "cost": 0,
          "monthlyRequ...
        }
        ```

**Interpretation of the Response:**

The server returned a 200 OK status, but the JSON body includes an "error" field.  The error message indicates that the server is expecting a response format of `'json_object'`, `'json_schema'`, or `'text'`, but received something that didn't match. This could be due to a misconfiguration on the server side regarding how it handles the response format based on the request parameters.

**Possible Problem:**

It's likely that the server is expecting a specific `Content-Type` header or some other form of data in the request body. Because it is passed to the URL, it is likely being treated as a get parameter rather than the format that the API is looking for.

It clearly says in your error message:

Invalid value: ‘json’

if you look at the “type” key in your response\_format variable at the top,

the value cannot be “json”

The error is telling you what the supported values are

‘json\_object’, ‘json\_schema’, and ‘text’

Since you are defining a schema the correct value should be ‘json\_schema’

So therefore you should change

```
"type": "json"

```

to

```
"type": "json_schema"

If you have trouble constructing Json schemas,  
either feed it to gpt and have it correct it (along with your error) or please go over Module 3, in particular

https://tds.s-anand.net/#/llm-text-extraction

There is a clear example you can use as a template. We use the same one as a template when we do it in the sessions. That way you will make less errors.

Kind regards
Here is a description of the content of the image:

**Content:**

The image shows the lowercase letter "s" in white, set against a dark green background. The letter appears to be in a simple, sans-serif font. The focus is entirely on the letter, with the background providing a solid, contrasting backdrop.

> @carlton @Jivraj Is there something like peer-review in the project, I found this in the grading document.

Anyone having any idea on this?
Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Impression:**

The image shows a medium shot of a man with a neutral to slightly serious expression. He is likely indoors, possibly near a window or doorway, as there are blurred elements suggesting greenery in the background.

**Subject Description:**

*   **Gender:** Male
*   **Age:** He appears to be in his late 20s to mid 30s.
*   **Facial Features:** He has dark hair and a light complexion. His eyebrows are dark and slightly arched. He has a neatly trimmed beard and mustache.
*   **Clothing:** He is wearing a patterned collared shirt. It appears to be a checkered or plaid pattern in shades of black, white, and gray.
*   **Expression:** He has a neutral expression.

**Background:**

The background is blurred but appears to include greenery. This suggests he might be standing near a window or a patio door looking outwards. There are also what appear to be some vertical wooden or dark-colored architectural elements.

**Other Observations:**

*   The lighting seems soft and natural.
*   The image is well-composed and in focus.

@lakshaygarg654

I know this is a late reply, but its not possible for us to consider changes to your project after the deadline for academic integrity purposes.

If we were to allow it, we would have to allow everyone to make changes to their project as well for it to be fair.

Kind regards

Alright, @Carlton. No problem at all, and thank you for your response.

I just wanted to bring a small limitation in my project’s LLM function to your attention, which I discovered after submission. It may impact one or two tasks. However, no concerns—this has been a great learning experience.

And if possible, just add one line in your Evaluation LLM prompt: *“Give loose marking for effort!”*—because, you know, creativity deserves some extra credit!
Here's a detailed description of the image you sent:

**Content:**

The image shows a digital rendering of a classic smiley face emoji.

**Features:**

*   **Shape:** The overall shape is a perfect circle.
*   **Color:** The face is a bright yellow color.
*   **Eyes:** It has two small, round, dark brown (almost black) eyes.
*   **Mouth:** The mouth is a simple, curved line depicting a subtle, closed smile. It's dark brown.
*   **Background:** The background is plain black.

**Interpretation:**

The image is a basic, universally recognized symbol of happiness or contentment.

**Content:**

The image features a single emoji. It is a **yellow face** with a **wide-open mouth** in a **big, happy smile**. 

*   **Color:** The face is a bright, sunny yellow. The inside of the mouth is dark brown with a pink tongue.
*   **Expression:** The overall expression is of pure joy, happiness, or excitement.
*   **Eyes:** It has oval-shaped, dark brown eyes.

**Possible Context/Meaning:**

This emoji is commonly used in digital communication to express feelings of happiness, excitement, amusement, or contentment. It's a very versatile emoji and its exact meaning depends on the context of the conversation.

***This docker image has outlived many students’ hopes, dreams and ambitions of passing this course.***

**Why is it still not being detected properly on the docker hub?**  
What in the April Fools is this

> It hasn’t even been morning yet!

PS ( @carlton @Jivraj ): My P1 submission had passed all the basic sanity checks on 15th February. No breaking modifications to the Github repo nor the DockerHub image have been made since then. There’s something bugged in your scripts. Kindly check.
Here's a detailed description of the image content:

The image shows a checklist or a report of some sort. It lists several criteria and their status (PASS or FAIL). Here's a breakdown:

*   **Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public:** FAIL - This indicates that a Docker image either isn't present on Docker Hub or, if present, isn't publicly accessible. This is circled with red to draw attention to it.
*   **Is Github repo present AND public:** PASS - A GitHub repository is present and publicly accessible.
*   **Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:** PASS - A Dockerfile is located at the root of the GitHub repository.
*   **Is MIT license present at root of github repo:** PASS - An MIT license file is present at the root of the GitHub repository.
*   **Prerequisites:** FAIL - Some prerequisites are not met.
*   **Project 1 Score:** 0 - The score for Project 1 is zero.

There is also "??? " scribbled near the middle right of the image.

Overall, the image represents a status report on a project, indicating that the GitHub repository is set up correctly with a Dockerfile and license, but the Docker image itself is not available on Docker Hub. Additionally, some prerequisites were not satisfied, resulting in a score of 0.
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

The image shows a table-like structure, likely a snippet from a software interface. It consists of three columns: "Last Pushed," "Contains," and "Visibility." Each column has two rows of data below the headers.

*   **Last Pushed:**
    *   Row 1: "about 2 hours ago"
    *   Row 2: "2 months ago"
*   **Contains:**
    *   Row 1: "IMAGE" (likely indicating that the push contained image files)
    *   Row 2: "IMAGE"
*   **Visibility:**
    *   Row 1: "Public"
    *   Row 2: "Public"

A red circle encompasses the "Public" text in the first row of the "Visibility" column. The text "about 2 hours ago" in the "Last Pushed" column has a red line under it.

The background is a dark color, and the text is white. There's also a blue arrow pointing upward next to the "Last Pushed" column header, possibly indicating that the data is sorted by the last pushed time in ascending order.
 Okay, let's analyze the image.

**Content:**

The image is a digital representation of an emoji. Specifically, it's the "Unamused Face" emoji. 

**Key Features:**

*   **Face:** The emoji is a yellow circle representing a face.
*   **Expression:** The face is unamused, showing slight discontent or skepticism. This is conveyed through:
    *   **Eyebrows:** The eyebrows are slightly furrowed and positioned asymmetrically, giving a subtle hint of disapproval or lack of enthusiasm. One eyebrow is raised slightly more than the other.
    *   **Eyes:** The eyes are brown and have a sidelong glance, suggesting doubt or indifference.
    *   **Mouth:** The mouth is a simple downturned line, indicating a lack of happiness or amusement.
*   **Color:** The face is primarily a light yellow color.
*   **Background:** The background is black, which helps to isolate the emoji.
*   **Style:** The emoji has a slightly pixelated or lower-resolution look, as opposed to being perfectly smooth.

@carlton @s.anand @Jivraj
Here's a breakdown of the image content:

**General Appearance:**

*   The image is a screenshot of a terminal window. The background is black, and the text is displayed in a green/yellow/cyan color scheme.
*   The terminal shows a user interacting with a command-line interface (CLI).

**Specific Content:**

1.  **User Prompt:**
    *   `hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~ (main)` This is the user prompt, showing:
        *   `hsent`: The username.
        *   `DESKTOP-89FBVHS`: The hostname (computer name).
        *   `MINGW64`: Likely indicates the environment (MinGW 64-bit).
        *   `~`: The current directory is the user's home directory.
        *   `(main)`: Potentially indicates the current branch in a Git repository.

2.  **Commands:**
    *   `cd hello_world`: The user changes the directory to `hello_world`.
    *   `ls -l Dockerfile`: The user attempts to list details for the `Dockerfile` (using the `ls` command with the `-l` flag for a long listing).
    *   `^[[200~ls -l Dockerfile`: This line shows the user trying to run an `ls -l Dockerfile` command, but the result got scrambled somehow. The characters `^[[200~` are likely accidental input that was not part of the intended command.

3.  **Error:**
    *   `bash: $'\E[200~1s': command not found`: This error message appears after the user types gibberish. The shell interprets the sequence of symbols that precedes the command as the command, but it can't find an executable file.

4.  **Output of `ls -l Dockerfile`:**
    *   `-rw-r--r-- 1 hsent 197609 343 Feb 16 18:50 Dockerfile`: This is the output of the `ls -l` command, which lists the file `Dockerfile`. The various details shown are:
        *   `-rw-r--r--`: File permissions.
        *   `1`: Number of hard links.
        *   `hsent`: Owner of the file.
        *   `197609`: The group the file belongs to.
        *   `343`: File size (in bytes).
        *   `Feb 16 18:50`: Last modified date and time.
        *   `Dockerfile`: The filename.

5.  **Final Line:**
    *   `^C`: This indicates the user has pressed CTRL+C, which typically sends an interrupt signal, stopping a command or process.

**Interpretation:**

The user navigates to the `hello_world` directory and then attempts to list the details of a file named `Dockerfile`. They enter a string of symbols, get an error, and then run `ls -l Dockerfile`. Finally, they abort the command with `Ctrl+C`.
 Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Overall:**

The image shows a screen capture of a GitHub repository interface. It appears to be the main landing page of a repository.

**Top Navigation:**

*   **Username/Repository:** In the top left corner, it shows the username "Harish018S" followed by a slash and the repository name "hello\_world". This indicates that the repository belongs to the user Harish018S and is named hello\_world.
*   **Navigation Tabs:** Below, a series of tabs are visible, typical of a GitHub repository: "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," "Actions," "Projects," "Wiki," "Security," "Insights," and "Settings." The "Code" tab is currently selected (highlighted).
*   **Search Bar:** In the top right, there is a search bar that says "Type / to search."
*   **Repository Actions:** Below the search, "Pin" and "Unwatch" options are displayed.

**Repository Details and Branch Information:**

*   **Repository Name:** Underneath the navigation tabs, the repository name "hello\_world" is repeated and labeled as "Public," meaning anyone can view it.
*   **Branch Selector:** A dropdown menu labelled "main" is visible, which suggests that the "main" branch is currently selected. The number of branches are 2.
*   **Tags:** Information about number of tags, which is currently 0.
*   **File Search:** A "Go to file" search box.
*   **Add File:** An "Add file" dropdown button.
*   **Code Button:** A green "<> Code" button.

**File List:**

*   The main part of the image shows a list of files in the repository:
    *   "LICENSE" with commit "Create LICENSE" which was 2 months ago.
    *   "README.md" with commit "Initial commit" which was 2 months ago.
    *   "app.py" with commit "Create app.py" which was 2 months ago.
    *   "README" and "MIT license"

**Commit Details:**

*   Next to the committer "Harish018S" and the message "Create app.py", there's a commit hash "ee31a25" and the indication that it was "2 months ago" with "4 Commits".

**In summary, the image depicts the code view of a simple GitHub repository named "hello\_world" owned by "Harish018S". The repository seems to contain at least an app.py and the image displays information about branches, tags, the files in the repository, and recent commits.**
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Context:**

The image is a screenshot of a Windows 11 file explorer window. The window is currently displaying the contents of a folder named "hello_world" within a user's directory.

**File Explorer Window Details:**

*   **Title Bar:** The window title is "hello\_world." The standard Windows close, maximize/restore, and minimize buttons are visible.
*   **Address Bar:** The path in the address bar shows the current location as "This PC > OS (C:) > Users > hsent > hello\_world." This indicates the folder is in the C: drive, under the Users folder, then the user "hsent", and finally within the "hello\_world" folder.
*   **Toolbar:** The toolbar contains several icons, including "New", "Cut", "Copy", "Paste", "Sort", and "View."
*   **Navigation Pane (Left Side):** The navigation pane on the left lists various locations, including "Downloads," "Documents," "Pictures," "Music," "Videos," other folders (e.g., "main," "invoice new 1," "Agent\_ai," "grok"), "This PC," "Network," and "Linux."
*   **File List (Right Side):** The main part of the window displays the contents of the "hello\_world" folder. The file list includes the following items:

    *   ".git" (File folder)
    *   "app" (Python Source File, 1KB)
    *   "Dockerfile" (File, 1KB)
    *   "LICENSE" (File, 2KB)
    *   "README" (Markdown Source File, 1KB)
    *   "requirements" (Text Document, 1KB)

    The "Date modified," "Type," and "Size" columns are visible for each file/folder.
*   **Search Bar:** A search bar is located in the upper right corner. The placeholder text reads "Search hello\_world."
*   **Details Pane:** A "Details" button is visible on the right of the window.
*   **Status Bar:** The status bar at the bottom of the window indicates "6 items" are in the current folder.

**Taskbar:**

*   The taskbar shows the Windows Start button, a search icon, icons for running applications (including a file explorer icon), Microsoft Teams, Visual Studio Code, a terminal, Docker Desktop, and Microsoft Edge.
*   On the right side of the taskbar are system icons for the language (ENG IN), network connection, volume, battery status, and the date and time (01-04-2025 11:32).

**In summary:**
This is a file explorer window in Windows 11 showing the files and folders inside the 'hello_world' directory within the user 'hsent' profile on the C drive. It's likely a project directory containing code, documentation and related files.

The image shows a terminal session, likely in a Linux environment, where a user named "hsent" is interacting with the command line. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Initial Prompt:**
    *   `hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~ (main)`:  This is the standard command prompt. It indicates:
        *   `hsent`:  The username.
        *   `DESKTOP-89FBVHS`: The hostname of the machine.
        *   `MINGW64`:  Indicates a MinGW environment, likely on Windows, providing a Unix-like environment.
        *   `~`:  Represents the user's home directory.
        *   `(main)`:  Likely indicates the current Git branch being used in that directory.
    *   `$`:  The prompt character, ready for a command.

2.  **Commands:**
    *   `cd hello_world`:  The user changes the current directory to "hello\_world".

3.  **Second Prompt:**
    *   `hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)`: The prompt changes to reflect the new current directory, now `~/hello_world`.

4.  **Erroneous Command:**
    *   `$^[[200~1s -1 Dockerfile`: This appears to be a malformed or incomplete command.  The presence of escape sequences like `^[[200~` suggest some sort of copy-paste or input error that inserted non-printable characters.
    *   `bash: $'\E [200~1s': command not found`:  The shell (Bash) interprets the erroneous input and reports that it's not a valid command.

5.  **Third Prompt:**
    *   `hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)`:  The prompt reappears after the failed command, indicating the shell is ready for a new command.

6. **Fourth Prompt:**
   *   `hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)`:  The prompt reappears after the failed command, indicating the shell is ready for a new command.

7.  **`ls` Command and Output:**
    *   `ls -l Dockerfile`: This command is intended to list the details of a file named "Dockerfile".  `-l` specifies a long listing format.
    *   `-rw-r--r-- 1 hsent 197609 343 Feb 16 18:50 Dockerfile`:  This is the output of the `ls -l` command.  It shows the file permissions, owner, size, modification date, and filename for "Dockerfile".

8.  **Final Prompt and Input**
    *   `hsent@DESKTOP-89FBVHS MINGW64 ~/hello_world (main)`:
    *   `$ AC`: User presses `CTRL + C`, terminating the current command.

**In summary:** The image shows a user navigating to a directory, encountering an error due to a mangled command, successfully using the `ls` command to view details about a file named "Dockerfile", and the pressing `CTRL + C` to abort the terminal session.
 Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Context:**

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall Structure:**

*   The image appears to be a screenshot of an email.

**Textual Content:**

*   **Sender/Timestamp:** The email is from "22t1 se2002" and was sent at "1:27 am." It's addressed "to me."
*   **Subject:** The email is about Project 1 prerequisites.
*   **Body:**

    *   It starts with "Dear Learner."
    *   It explains that Project 1 has prerequisite checks detailed on the "TDS Project 1: Evaluation page" (hyperlinked).
    *   It lists the following prerequisite requirements:
        1.  GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible.
        2.  GitHub repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT license.
        3.  GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
        4.  Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via "podman run -e AIPROXY\_TOKEN=$AIPROXY\_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE\_NAME".
        5.  Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub repository.
    *   It states that failing to meet the minimum requirements will result in the submission not being evaluated.
    *   It provides the results of the prerequisite evaluations:
        *   Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
        *   Is Github repo present AND public: FAIL
        *   Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL
        *   Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL
    *   "Prerequisites: FAIL"
    *   "Project 1 Score: 0"

**Key Observations:**

*   The email is a feedback or evaluation report on the prerequisites for a "Project 1."
*   The learner has passed the Docker image requirement but failed the GitHub repository, Dockerfile, and MIT license requirements.
*   The project score is currently 0, likely due to the failed prerequisites.
*   The email is likely automated, providing a summary of the status of the project against specific requirements.

In essence, the image depicts an email indicating that a learner has failed to meet some crucial prerequisites for Project 1 and, therefore, has a score of 0.
