Despite saving multiple times, my score keeps resetting to zero. Should I refill the answers for all the questions before saving again? Could this issue also be caused by accessing the assignment from multiple devices?

Hi Shalini,

We are aware of the issue and @s.anand is working on a solution. The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed.

**The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions.**

Kind regards

Hello,  
I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?

That's a close-up headshot of Iranian-American artist and filmmaker, Shirin Neshat. 


Here's a description of the image:

* **Subject:** The photo shows Neshat from the chest up, angled slightly away from the camera. Her expression is somewhat serious and pensive.

* **Lighting:** The lighting is dramatic, with a strong light source seemingly coming from the side, creating shadows on her face and adding depth. This contributes to a somewhat moody or intense atmosphere.

* **Appearance:** Neshat appears to be middle-aged in the image. Her hair is short and dark, and she's wearing what looks like a dark-colored collared shirt or jacket. Her glasses are partially visible. The focus is primarily on her face and upper body.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is not exceptionally sharp; it appears somewhat grainy or compressed, typical of an older photograph or a lower-resolution scan. The background is a blurred, indistinct dark brownish-red tone.

* **Overall Impression:** The photo conveys a sense of seriousness and introspection, reflecting the often intense themes explored in Neshat's artwork.  The lighting and composition of the photo play a significant role in conveying this mood.

That's a close-up shot of a man's head and shoulders. 


Here's a breakdown of the image:

* **The Man:** He appears to be middle-aged, with light to medium brown skin. His hair is short, somewhat graying or light brown, and slightly receding. He's wearing glasses, and his expression is somewhat serious or pensive.  The lighting is dramatic, highlighting one side of his face and leaving the other in shadow. He seems to be wearing a dark-colored shirt or jacket.

* **The Background:** The background is a blurry, solid, dark reddish-brown color, which provides a simple contrast to the man's face.

* **Image Quality:** The image quality is not very high; it appears somewhat grainy or pixelated, suggesting it might be an older photo or a low-resolution scan.


There is no text in the image.  The focus is entirely on the portrait of the man.  The image doesn't offer any clues to his identity beyond his appearance.
