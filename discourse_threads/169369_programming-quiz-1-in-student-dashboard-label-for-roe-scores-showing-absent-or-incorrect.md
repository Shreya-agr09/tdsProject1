Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a student's online course progress report for a course titled "Tools in Data Science".  The top section displays a dark maroon background with a pattern of small dots, creating a textured effect.  The course title, "Tools in Data Science," is prominently displayed in large, white, bold lettering. Below the title, "NEW COURSE" is written in smaller, white, bold letters.

The bottom section shows a light gray area containing a list of weekly assignments and their corresponding scores.  Each line lists the week number, followed by "Assignment" and then the numerical score out of a possible 100.  The scores are:

* Week 1: 80.00
* Week 2: 65.00
* Week 3: 21.10
* Week 4: 20.00
* Week 5: 90.00

Finally, the last line indicates that the student is "Absent" for "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1".  The overall style is clean and simple, typical of an online learning platform's interface.

Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

The image shows a computer screen displaying a simple webpage or application interface. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:** The top section displays a login message: "You are logged in as 23f3004246@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."  Below this is a button labeled "Logout".

* **Middle Section:** A pale green box dominates the middle. The box's title is "Recent saves".  A small parenthetical note below the title reads "(most recent is your official score)".

* **Bottom Section (within the green box):**  Three identical rows are displayed, each with a "Reload" button and data. Each row presents a timestamp (e.g., "from 3/2/2025, 1:44:11 PM."), and a score (e.g., "Score: 6"). The timestamps indicate saved data at different times on March 2nd, 2025.

The overall style of the webpage is minimalist and functional. The color scheme is muted, using mainly white and a light green. The buttons are simple and clearly labeled. The information presented is clear and easy to understand.

Hi @carlton @Jivraj sir,

I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”

I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?

Thank you

I’m experiencing a similar issue, I attended and submitted the exam but it’s showing absent
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a digital representation of a course overview, possibly from an online learning platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** At the top, a dark-red background with a subtle pattern of small dots features the title "Tools in Data Science" in a large, white, sans-serif font. Below this, "NEW COURSE" is written in a smaller, but still prominent, white font.

* **Course Progress:** Below the header, a light-beige or off-white section displays the progress of the course.  This lists each week's assignment, along with the score achieved (or "Absent" if not completed).  Scores are given in numerical format (e.g., "57.50," "100.00").

* **Button:** At the bottom, a gold-colored button with a right-pointing arrow says "Go to Course page >".  This suggests the image is a summary and invites the user to access the full course page.

* **Overall Style:** The overall design is clean, modern, and professional. The color scheme is predominantly dark red and gold, suggesting sophistication and potentially a focus on professionalism in the data science field.

The image is likely a screenshot or mockup of a dashboard showing a student's progress on a specific online course.

The text is in a simple, sans-serif font and is dark gray or black against a light gray background. The background is uniformly colored and plain. There are no other visual elements present; the image is essentially a snippet of text on a blank background.

I’m experiencing a similar issue, I attended and submitted the exam but it’s showing absent
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a digital representation of a course overview, likely from an online learning platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the visual elements:

* **Header:** The top section features a dark maroon background with a subtle dotted pattern and a curved gradient effect.  The text "Tools in Data Science" is prominently displayed in a large, white, sans-serif font. Below it, in a smaller white font, is "NEW COURSE."

* **Course Progress:** Underneath the header, a lighter-colored section displays the progress in the course. It lists:
    * "Week 1 Assignment - 57.50"
    * "Week 2 Assignment - 75.00"
    * "Week 3 Assignment - 100.00"
    * "Week 4 Assignment - 100.00"
    * "Week 5 Assignment - 100.00"
    * "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent"

  The numbers after the assignments likely represent scores or points earned.


* **Call to Action:** At the bottom, a button with a gold background and darker text says "Go to Course page >". The ">" indicates a link to the course page.


The overall style is clean, modern, and uses a professional color palette.  The design effectively communicates information about the course and encourages the user to proceed.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a student's online course progress report. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Header:** The top section has a dark maroon background with a textured pattern of small dots. Over this is the title "Tools in Data Science" in large, white, bold text. Below it, in smaller white text, is "NEW COURSE".

* **Body:** The central portion displays a list of assignments and grades. Each line shows the week number, the assignment type ("Assignment"), and the score achieved (or "Absent").  The scores are numerical, ranging from 40.00 to 87.50. One item is labeled "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1".

* **Footer:** The bottom section contains a button or link that says "Go to Course page >" in a golden-yellow color on a lighter background.

The overall impression is a clean, organized presentation of course progress information. The dark maroon color scheme contributes to a professional and potentially academic feel.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a computer screen displaying a simple interface, likely part of an online test or quiz platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:** The top displays a login message: "You are logged in as 23f2005141@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." This indicates the user's login ID, suggesting a university or educational institution setting (iitm.ac.in likely refers to a domain name). A red "Logout" button is present below this message.

* **Middle Section:** A pale green box titled "Recent saves" is the main focus. It contains information about saved progress, indicating that the most recent save is considered the official score.

* **Bottom Section (within the green box):** Three entries are listed, each showing:
    * A blue "Reload" button.
    * A date and timestamp (all on March 2nd, 2025).
    * A score of "6" for each entry.

The overall impression is of a clean, straightforward interface for reviewing saved results within an online assessment system.  The repeated score of 6 suggests multiple attempts at a question or section of a test.

Sir I gave ROE TDS exam and even submitted it and got many correct answer but it is showing absent in my dashboard.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Course Progress:** Below the header, a light-colored box displays the student's progress.  It lists the scores for each week's assignment:

    * Week 1: 100.00
    * Week 2: 85.00
    * Week 3: 100.00
    * Week 4: 110.00

    It also indicates that the student was "Absent" for Programming Quiz 1.

* **Call to Action:** At the bottom, a button with the text "Go to Course page >" encourages the user to visit the course page.


The overall design is simple, uncluttered, and easy to read, with a clear focus on conveying the course information and prompting the user to continue.

24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.

My roll number is 24F1001631.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-green rectangular panel displaying a list of recent game saves. 


**Key Features:**

* **Title:** At the top, the text "Recent saves" is clearly visible, followed by "(most recent is your official score)" in smaller text.  This indicates these are saved game states, with the most recent one representing the official score.

* **Save Entries:**  The panel shows three separate save entries, each with:
    * A blue "Reload" button. This likely allows the user to load that specific save.
    * The date and time of the save (all from March 2nd, 2025, at various times).
    * The score achieved in the game at that point.

* **Overall Style:** The panel has a dark, almost black, background, with the text appearing in a light, slightly greenish color, creating good contrast.  The buttons are a distinct blue, making them stand out visually.  The overall design suggests a user interface element from a game or application.


The image only shows the save entries; there's no other context provided.

We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.

Bottom line: wait till Tuesday  
Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.  
If not let us know

Kind regards.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** The top section displays "Tools in Data Science" in a large, bold font, indicating the course title. Below it, "NEW COURSE" is written in a smaller font, highlighting the course's new status. The background of this header section is a dark maroon with a subtle dotted pattern.

* **Course Details:** Below the header, a list details the course assignments. Each line shows a week number (Week 1, Week 2, etc.), followed by "Assignment" and a score of "100.00". This suggests that all the assignments have been completed with full marks.  The final line shows "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent," indicating that this quiz has not been taken.

* **Call to Action:** At the very bottom, a button labeled "Go to Course page >" prompts the user to proceed to the course page for more details or actions.


The overall design is clean and professional, typical of an educational platform's interface. The color scheme is primarily dark maroon and light gray, maintaining a consistent look throughout.

Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a webpage or app screen displaying information about a "Tools in Data Science" course. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Header:** At the top, a dark reddish-brown banner with a subtle dotted pattern reads "Tools in Data Science" in a large, bold, white font. Below that, in a smaller white font, it says "NEW COURSE".

* **Course Details:** Below the banner, a light-grey area lists the assignments for each week of the course. Each line shows the week number, "Assignment", and the score (in points). The scores are:
    * Week 1: 100.00
    * Week 2: 65.00
    * Week 3: 100.00
    * Week 4: 110.00
    * Week 5: 100.00
    There's also a line indicating that "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1" is "Absent".

* **Call to Action:** At the very bottom, a gold-colored button says "Go to Course page >" indicating a link to access the course material.

Overall, the design is clean and simple, using a visually appealing color scheme and clear typography to present the course information effectively.  The layout is vertically oriented, with clear separation between sections.

Hi Team, I have appeared for ROE TDS 2025 and have secured 3 marks, but my score is shown as zero in the dashboard.

Please clarify.  

image930×584 42.8 KB
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a webpage displaying a student's current courses. 


**Top Section:**

* **Headline:** "My Current Courses" is prominently displayed at the top.
* **GPA Information:** Below the headline, it shows the student's Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) as 7.8 and their Project CGPA as 0.0.  Both GPAs are indicated as being "till this term."


**Course Cards:**

Two course cards are displayed below the GPA information. Each card has:

* **Course Title:** The title of the course is shown in a large font. ("Business Data Management" and "Tools in Data Science").
* **Course Status:**  A smaller line indicates the status: "REPEAT FULL COURSE" for the first, and "NEW COURSE" for the second.
* **Assignments:** A list of weekly assignment scores is provided for each course. Some assignments have scores of 0.00, indicating they haven't been completed yet.  The "Tools in Data Science" course also includes a "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent" entry.
* **Button:** A "Go to Course page >" button is at the bottom of each card.


**Overall:**

The design is clean and simple, using dark red/maroon for the course card backgrounds, which provides a nice contrast to the lighter text and buttons. The information is presented in an organized and easy-to-read format. The page is likely from a learning management system (LMS) or a similar online platform used for tracking academic progress.
