I will be at the IIT Madras campus next Wednesday (5 Feb) from 10:30 am to 2:30 pm IST.

I’ll be at the NAC (New Academic Complex) or the NAC footsteps.

If anyone would like to chat - about TDS, or anything else - you’re welcome.

Here's a description of the image:

The image is a screenshot of a webpage or document showing a profile of someone named Anand S. The text is neatly formatted and easy to read.  

The top section features "**Anand S.**" in a bold, large font, followed by "CEO, Gramener" in a smaller font.  Below this is a horizontal line and the word "Profile," indicating the start of a biographical description.

The main body of the text gives details about Anand's accomplishments and personality:

* **Professional:** He's a co-founder of Gramener (a data science company), leads a team focused on data visualization, is recognized as a top scientist in India, and is a regular TEDx speaker. He also lists impressive credentials including IIM Bangalore, IIT Madras, and several major companies like IBM and Lehman Brothers.

* **Personal:**  The text highlights his unusual hobbies: hand-transcribing every Calvin & Hobbes comic strip, playing Minecraft, and his ambition to watch every film on the IMDb Top 250 list (except for "The Shining").

The final line provides links to his blog ("s-anand.net") and his talks ("bit.ly/anandtalks").

The overall impression is a professional yet personable profile, showcasing Anand's significant achievements and unique personality traits. The use of bold font and clear structuring makes the information easily digestible.

Thank you for taking out time to meet today. It was great to meet you Sir, and was a great pleasant surprise to meet our wonderful TAs, @carlton and @jivraj (and, TAs for Java and Statistics I too. sorry, I am unable to tag them with names) as well. I am inspired to continue learning deeper and more… such interactions are very helpful. Thank you.
