@carlton Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.

Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a Google Sheets access request screen. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Left:** The Google Sheets logo is displayed.

* **Center:** A prominent message reads "You need access". Below this, there's a smaller line of text: "Request access, or switch to an account with access." A link to "Learn more" is provided.

* **Middle Section:** A text box is available to type an optional message.

* **Bottom Middle:** A blue button says "Request access".

* **Bottom Right:** It indicates the currently signed-in user's email address: "22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This is shown after "You're signed in as".

* **Right Side (Visual):** A graphic shows a stylized illustration of a person walking through a keyhole in a document, suggesting the need for access.  A small green circle and a pale pink shape are present near the illustration.


The overall design is clean and minimalistic, characteristic of Google's interface style. The colors are primarily white, light green, and blue.  The image clearly communicates the user needs to request access to a Google Sheet.
 Here's a description of the image:

The image contains a set of instructions, labeled "Tasks:", outlining two steps for a Google Sheets assignment.

**Task 1:** Involves creating a new, blank Google Sheet workbook.  The workbook must be named using a specific format: "ga.7.1.rollno," where "rollno" should be replaced with the user's IITM roll number (excluding the domain).

**Task 2:** Requires sharing the created workbook with editing rights to a specific email address: `se2002@study.iitm.ac.in`. A crucial note is added, stating that if this sharing step isn't completed first, the submission will not be considered, even if a blank workbook is submitted.

The instructions are straightforward and emphasize the importance of following both steps precisely, particularly the sharing requirement. The email address provided is likely that of an instructor or grader.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a Google Sheets access request screen. 


Here's a breakdown of the elements:

* **Top Left:** The Google Sheets logo is displayed.

* **Center:** The main text prominently reads "You need access". Below this, there's a smaller instruction: "Request access, or switch to an account with access." A "Learn more" link provides additional information.

* **Middle Section:** A text box is provided with the label "Message (optional)" for the user to input any message to the spreadsheet owner.

* **Button:** A blue button is centrally located, labeled "Request access," prompting the user to submit their access request.

* **Bottom Section:** The screen displays the currently signed-in user's email address: "22f2000644@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" with a small person icon to its left. This confirms the user's identity.

* **Right Side:** An illustration shows a stylized person walking through an open door or keyhole in a document, visually representing the action of accessing a spreadsheet. There's a small green circle next to the document, possibly an indicator.

The overall design is clean, minimalistic, and consistent with Google's design language.  The image clearly communicates that the user needs to request access to a Google Sheet.
 The image contains instructions labeled "Tasks:" with two numbered steps.  The steps detail requirements for submitting a Google Sheet workbook:

1. **Workbook Creation:** Create a new, blank Google Sheet workbook.  The workbook must be named using a specific format:  `ga.7.1.rollno`, where `rollno` should be replaced with the user's IITM roll number (excluding the domain).

2. **Sharing:**  The workbook must be shared with editing rights with the email address `se2002@study.iitm.ac.in`.  The instructions strongly emphasize that failure to complete this step first will result in the submission being rejected.  A blank workbook will not be considered without the sharing step being done first.
