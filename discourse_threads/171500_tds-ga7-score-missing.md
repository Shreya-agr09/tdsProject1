Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done.  
(roughly 3 days before end term).

Kind regards

@carlton @Jivraj

What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can’t leave it blank.

Just put zero there. Since all the quantitative answers are positive.

You were sent an email about it. With the peers to review. It came from the official TDS email.

You were sent an email on the 1st of April.

Kind regards

Hi @carlton sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

Here's a detailed description of the image content:

**Overall:**

The image is a screenshot of a Gmail inbox. The user seems to have searched for "peer review" as it is displayed in the search bar. The inbox contains a list of emails, and the search has likely filtered them to show those related to "peer review."

**Email Details:**

*   **Email 1:** From Google Forms 9 with subject "TDS Jan 2025 - GA 7 Review - GA 7 Review Here's what was received. Edit response".
*   **Email 2:** From 22t1 se2002 with subject "[TDS Jan 25] BONUS 5 Marks to T Score - submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission. Ple...". It has three attached files named:
    *   23f3003944.html
    *   23f3001178.html
    *   23f2001738.html
*   **Email 3:** From 22t1 se2002 with subject "[TDS Jan 25] GA 7 Peer allocations - submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission. Please fi...". It also has three attached files named:
    *   24f1002555.html
    *   23f1001126.html
    *   23f3003944.html

**Other Elements:**

*   Gmail logo is present at the top left.
*   Standard Gmail interface elements: "Mail", "Conversations", "Spaces" tabs, search bar, settings icon, help icon, Google Apps icon, and account icon (IIT Madras).
*   Email management buttons: "Archive", "Delete", "Mark as Read", "Snooze".
*   Pagination information: "1-29 of 29".

**Key Features:**

*   The presence of multiple emails related to "TDS Jan 25," suggesting a course or project.
*   The phrase "submit 3 peer evaluations" appearing in the subject lines of multiple emails indicating the importance of peer evaluation.
*   The attached HTML files may contain the peer evaluations themselves.
*   The repeated file names suggest this image is asking the model to pay attention to the existence of 23f3003944.html.
