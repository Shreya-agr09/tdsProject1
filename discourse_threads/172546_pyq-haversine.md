    *   It outlines a step-by-step process:
        1.  "Convert degrees to radians": It provides the formula: `radians = (π/180) * degrees`
        2.  "Calculate differences in latitude and longitude":  It describes how to find Δφ and Δλ.
        3.  "Apply the Haversine formula":  It shows the Haversine formula to calculate distance 'd' (the main formula involving arcsin and trigonometric functions) along with Radius of the Earth
*   **Student Input:**
    *   "Yes, I converted the latitude and longitude for Location A and Location B to radians. Here's what I got:"
    *   It then lists the latitude and longitude values (in radians) for Location A and Location B:
        *   φ1 (Latitude of Location A): 0.7112 radians
        *   λ1 (Longitude of Location A): -1.2915 radians
        *   φ2 (Latitude of Location B): 0.7116 radians
