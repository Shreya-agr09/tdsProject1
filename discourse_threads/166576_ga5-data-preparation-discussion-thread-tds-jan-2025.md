i can’t load my questions
The image shows a screenshot of a web page, likely an online exam platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Top Section:** Displays a login message indicating the user is logged in with the email address `23f1002630@ds.study.litm.ac.in`. A "Logout" button is also present.

* **Middle Section (Top):** Shows a section titled "Recent saves," indicating that no recent saves exist.

* **Middle Section (Middle):** A progress indicator labeled "Loading questions..." suggests that the system is attempting to load exam questions. A circular loading icon (the letter "C") is displayed alongside the text.

* **Middle Section (Bottom):** An error message box is displayed, indicating a failure to load the questions.  The error message provides details: "Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange. Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')" and instructs the user to contact the exam team for assistance. The error suggests a JavaScript error in the application.

* **Overall Appearance:** The interface uses a dark theme with contrasting colors for text and backgrounds. The error message box is highlighted with a dark red color to draw attention to the problem.


In short, the image shows a user encountering a technical issue while taking an online exam. The system is unable to load the questions, resulting in an error message.

@23f1002630 - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.

**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

It was solved but again I’m facing the same issue
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of what appears to be a web-based exam or quiz interface. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible elements:

* **Top Section (Dark Green):** This section displays "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" and below it, "No recent saves". This suggests a feature to save progress.

* **Middle Section (Dark Teal):** A progress bar or indicator is visible with the text "Loading questions...". This indicates the system is attempting to load the quiz questions.

* **Bottom Section (Dark Red):** This section displays an "Error!" message. The error message details the problem: "Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange. Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1'). Please contact the exam team for assistance."  This is a JavaScript error message, suggesting a programming error on the server-side is preventing the questions from loading.

* **Buttons at the Bottom:** Two buttons are present: "Check all" and "Save." These are likely actions to manage the answers and save progress, respectively.  They are currently inactive due to the error.

The overall design is dark-themed, with sections differentiated by color. The error message clearly indicates a problem loading the quiz content.  The error message itself is specific enough that a developer would have no trouble troubleshooting it.

That's a screenshot of a spreadsheet program, likely Microsoft Excel or a similar application. 


Here's a breakdown of the image's content:

* **Spreadsheet Structure:** The image shows a portion of a spreadsheet with columns labeled "city," "product," and "sales."  The cells are filled with data.  The header row is highlighted in an orange/peach color.  The row numbers are visible on the left.  There is also a small triangle in the upper left corner, usually indicating sorting or filtering options.

* **Data Content:** The "city" column contains variations of "Sao Paulo" (with some minor spelling inconsistencies). The "product" column consistently shows "Bacon". The "sales" column contains numerical values representing sales figures.  There is a sum of the sales in cell C2502, totaling 2871.

* **Data Type:** The data types are consistent: text for "city" and "product," and numbers for "sales."

* **Software:** The visual style suggests a spreadsheet program commonly found in productivity suites like Microsoft Office or LibreOffice.


In short, the image shows a simple sales data table summarizing bacon sales in Sao Paulo. The inconsistencies in the spelling of "Sao Paulo" in the "city" column might indicate data entry errors.

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

The image contains a document outlining a data analysis task.  The task involves analyzing a Gzipped Apache log file (61MB) containing 258,074 rows of web server access logs for the website `s-anand.net`. The goal is to determine the number of successful GET requests made to pages under the `/telugu/` directory on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00 (GMT-0500) during May 2024.

The document provides the following details:

* **Data Source:** A Gzipped Apache log file.
* **Data Format:**  Space-separated fields, mostly double-quoted, with some exceptions and escaping issues (affecting 41 rows). The `Time` field is not quoted.
* **Data Fields:**  `IP`, `Remote logname`, `Remote user`, `Time`, `Request`, `Status`, `Size`, `Referer`, `User agent`, `Vhost`, `Server`.  The `Request` field is further broken down into `Method`, `URL`, and `Protocol`.
* **Time Zone:** GMT-0500
* **Success Criteria:** HTTP status codes between 200 and 299.
* **Filtering Criteria:**  Only GET requests, specifically to `/telugu/` pages, occurring on Saturdays between 13:00 and before 23:00 in May 2024.
* **Objectives:** The analysis will help with resource scaling, content planning, and marketing insights.

The document also provides a detailed description of each field in the log file, highlighting potential challenges in parsing the data (non-standard quoting, escaped quotes).  The final question explicitly asks for the count of successful GET requests meeting the specified criteria.

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-

Thank you

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.

Please consider my request and double check-

@Jivraj, @carlton

Here's a description of the image content:

The image shows a case study document outlining a data recovery task for ReceiptRevive Analytics.  The document is primarily text-based, with sections clearly defined by headings and bullet points.

**Key Content Sections:**

* **Case Study Introduction:** This section sets the context, explaining that ReceiptRevive Analytics is a data recovery firm specializing in processing legacy sales data from paper receipts using OCR. It highlights the challenges posed by damaged or incomplete receipts leading to truncated JSON data. The client, RetailFlow Inc., needs to recover total sales data from 100 rows of potentially incomplete JSON data.

* **Data Structure:** The document clearly specifies that each row of JSON data is expected to contain four keys: `city`, `product`, `sales`, and `id`. It emphasizes that due to damage, the `id` field is missing from many entries.

* **Your Task:** This section defines the three key tasks:
    1. **Parse the Sales Data:** Extract `sales` values from the provided JSON file, handling missing data gracefully.
    2. **Data Validation and Cleanup:** Ensure data quality, focusing solely on the `sales` values due to the missing `id` field.
    3. **Calculate Total Sales:** Sum the extracted `sales` values to get the total sales recorded.

* **Client Benefits:** This section explains the value proposition for RetailFlow Inc., highlighting how recovering the sales data will help them: reconstruct historical sales, inform business decisions, enhance data recovery processes, and build client trust in ReceiptRevive's services.

* **Data Download:**  The document includes a link or filename indicating where the JSON data can be downloaded (`q-parse-partial-json.jsonl`).


**Visual Features:**

The document uses a clean, professional layout with clear headings, bullet points, and a consistent font style. The key terms like "sales," "id," and "JSON" are potentially highlighted or bolded (difficult to definitively say without a higher-resolution image), drawing attention to important aspects of the task.  The overall tone is formal and instructional, typical of a technical assignment or case study.

but this is not correct please guide
The image shows a spreadsheet with data about sales and costs of a product "Kappa" in the United Arab Emirates. 


Here's a breakdown of the content:

* **Columns:** The spreadsheet has at least four columns:
    * **Country (Normalised):**  This column shows that all entries are from the "United Arab Emirates".
    * **DATE:** This column lists various dates in YYYY-MM-DD or MM-DD-YYYY format, indicating sales transactions across different months and years.
    * **Product:** This column consistently shows "Kappa" as the product sold.
    * **Sales:** This column shows the sales amount for each transaction in a currency (likely AED, given the country).
    * **Cost:** This column shows the cost associated with each transaction.

* **Rows:** Each row represents a single sales transaction, containing the date, product, sales amount, and cost.  There are 15 rows visible in the image.

* **Headers:** The columns have headers clearly identifying their content.

* **Formatting:** The spreadsheet uses a light blue background for its cells, providing visual clarity.  The headers are dark blue.  Numbers are formatted as currency (with two decimal places).

The data suggests a record of sales and costs for the product "Kappa" in the United Arab Emirates over a period of time, spanning at least two years.  It's likely this data is part of a larger dataset that could be analyzed to understand sales trends, profitability, or other business metrics.

@23f1003186 – thanks for flagging this. You’re right. I’ve fixed this error.
That's an emoji depicting two hands pressed together in a gesture of prayer or supplication. 


Here's a breakdown of its visual features:

* **Hands:** The central focus is a pair of hands, rendered in a simple, cartoonish style.  They are yellow or gold, with the fingers slightly stylized and not perfectly realistic. The hands are positioned with palms together, fingers overlapping.

* **Fingers:** The fingers are relatively short and slightly rounded. They are not individually detailed.

* **Skin Tone:** The hands are a light yellowish-gold tone.

* **Sleeves/Cuffs:** The hands appear to be wearing clothing with short, light blue sleeves or cuffs at the wrists. These are a solid color, without any detail or texture.

* **Style:** The overall style is consistent with other emojis — simple, blocky shapes and limited detail.  The image is pixelated, suggesting a digital origin.

* **Background:** The background is transparent, meaning it's designed to be placed over various other backgrounds without any visual interference from a background color.


The emoji is easily recognizable and universally understood as a symbol of prayer, hope, or pleading.

@23f1003186 thanks again for flagging this. This is fixed, too.
That's an emoji depicting two hands pressed together in a gesture of prayer or supplication. 


Here's a breakdown of its visual features:

* **Hands:** Two yellow hands are shown, with fingers interlocked and palms pressed together. The fingers are slightly stylized, not perfectly realistic.  The skin tone is a uniform light yellow-gold.

* **Sleeves:** The hands are partially covered by light blue sleeves or cuffs, suggesting clothing.

* **Style:** The emoji is in a pixelated or blocky style, typical of digital emoji design.  The lines are not smooth; instead, they have a slightly jagged, low-resolution appearance.

* **Color Palette:** The primary colors are yellow (hands) and light blue (sleeves), with a darker brown-orange used for the details in the fingers where they interlock. The background is transparent.


The overall impression is a simple, readily understandable depiction of prayer or pleading.

Date formatted and filtered successfully
The image contains a table showing sales data. The table has six columns and six rows of data. The columns are:

* **Country (Normalised):** This column contains the country name, which is "United Arab Emirates" for all rows.
* **DATE:** This column lists dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. The dates range from 2022-01-15 to 2023-02-07.
* **Product:** This column shows the product name "Kappa" for all rows.
* **Sales:** This column lists sales figures in a format that seems to be currency (possibly AED, the currency of the UAE), with two decimal places.
* **Cost:** This column lists cost figures in a currency format similar to the "Sales" column, with two decimal places.

The table suggests a sales report for Kappa products sold in the United Arab Emirates across different dates.  The filtering icons (✔ and ☑) next to "DATE" and "Product" suggest that the data might be from a filterable spreadsheet or database.

How many units of Computer were sold in London on transactions with at least 39 units?  
please check my answer is not correct - (6193)

please guide
The image shows a table with three columns: "city," "product," and "sales."  All the entries in the "city" column are "London," and all the entries in the "product" column are "Computer."  The "sales" column contains various numerical values representing sales figures, ranging from 109 to 975.  The table appears to be a section of a spreadsheet or database application.  The column headers include dropdown arrows, suggesting that the table can be filtered or sorted by these columns.

i can’t load my questions
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a dark-themed web page or application interface, likely related to an online exam or quiz. 


Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Login Information:** At the top, it displays a login message indicating the user "23f1002630@ds.study.litm.ac.in" is logged in, along with a "Logout" button.

* **Recent Saves Section:** A dark-green box labeled "Recent saves" shows a message "No recent saves."  It also indicates that the most recent save represents the official score.

* **Loading Questions Section:** A teal-colored box displays "Loading questions..." with a circular loading icon (the letter "C").

* **Error Message Section:** A prominent red box displays an "Error!" message.  The error details are:
    * "Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange."
    * "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')"
    * "Please contact the exam team for assistance." This suggests a problem with the application's ability to retrieve the exam questions.

The overall appearance is clean and simple, with clear visual cues for different sections. The error message is highlighted by its red background, making it the most noticeable part of the screen. The use of dark colors suggests a modern and potentially minimalist design. The entire interface indicates a problem preventing the user from accessing the exam.

Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screenshot of a dark-themed web interface, likely from an online exam or quiz platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible sections:

* **Top Section (Dark Green):** This box displays information about recent saves.  It currently states "No recent saves."

* **Middle Section (Dark Teal):** This box shows a loading indicator (a circular progress bar) with the text "Loading questions..." This suggests that the system is attempting to load the quiz questions.

* **Bottom Section (Dark Red):** This section displays an error message. The heading is "Error!". The error message itself explains that the questions could not be loaded, citing a specific JavaScript error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')".  It also provides instructions to contact the exam team for assistance.

* **Bottom Buttons:** At the very bottom of the screenshot, there are two buttons: "Check all" and "Save".

The overall appearance suggests a problem loading the exam questions. The error message indicates a technical issue preventing the system from functioning correctly. The dark color scheme is consistent throughout the interface.

That's a screenshot of a spreadsheet program, likely Microsoft Excel or a similar application. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Columns:** The spreadsheet shows three columns:
    * **Column A (city):** Contains city names, all variations of "Sao Paulo" with slight spelling inconsistencies.
    * **Column B (product):**  Lists the product, consistently "Bacon."
    * **Column C (sales):** Shows numerical sales data.

* **Rows:** Several rows contain data representing sales of bacon in Sao Paulo.  The last row in the visible portion (row 2502) appears to be a summary row, showing a total of 2871.

* **Header Row:** The first row (row 1) contains headers for each column: "city," "product," and "sales".  These headers are highlighted in a light orange fill. The headers also have a small filter icon next to them, suggesting that filtering and sorting capabilities are available.

* **Data inconsistencies:** There are slight inconsistencies in the spelling of "Sao Paulo" in Column A ("Sau Paulo," "Sao Pualo," "Sao Paoulo," "Sao Paolo," "Sao Pualo").

* **Summary:** The bottom of the visible data shows a sum of the sales figures in column C (2871), possibly automatically calculated by the spreadsheet software.

* **Spreadsheet appearance:** The spreadsheet has a standard appearance, with gray cell borders and a dark gray header row.  Row numbers are visible to the left.

In short, the image displays a simple sales report, likely a subset of a larger dataset, showing bacon sales from different records in Sao Paulo. The inconsistent spelling of the city name suggests potential data entry errors that might need to be cleaned up.

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

This image contains a document outlining a data analysis task.  The task involves analyzing a large Apache web server log file (61MB, 258,074 rows) to determine the number of successful GET requests made to the `/telugu/` section of the website `s-anand.net` on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00 during May 2024.

The document provides the following information:

* **Context:** The website `s-anand.net` hosts music, with a particularly popular section dedicated to Telugu content.  The goal of the analysis is to optimize server resources and content strategy based on peak usage patterns.

* **Data:** The data resides in a Gzipped Apache log file.  The log file has a non-standard format: fields are space-separated, mostly double-quote enclosed (except the `Time` field), with some escaping inconsistencies affecting 41 rows.  The timezone is GMT-0500.

* **Data Fields:** The log file contains the following fields: `IP`, `Remote logname`, `Remote user`, `Time`, `Request`, `Status`, `Size`, `Referer`, `User agent`, `Vhost`, `Server`.  The `Request` field is further divided into Method, URL, and Protocol.

* **Criteria for Successful Requests:**  The analysis should only count GET requests with HTTP status codes between 200 and 299.

* **Task:**  The core task is to count the number of successful GET requests meeting the above criteria during the specified time window and days.

* **Objectives:** The results of the analysis will support:
    * **Optimizing Infrastructure:** Scaling servers to handle peak load.
    * **Strategizing Content Delivery:**  Improving content based on popularity.
    * **Improving Marketing Efforts:**  Focusing marketing on peak usage times.

The document also includes a detailed description of each field in the log file, highlighting potential challenges (e.g., inconsistent quoting, non-standard formatting).  This information is crucial for anyone attempting to perform the data analysis.  The final question explicitly asks for the answer—the count of successful GET requests that meet all conditions.

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-

Thank you

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.

Please consider my request and double check-

@Jivraj, @carlton

Thank you

The image contains a case study document titled "Case Study: Recovering Sales Data for ReceiptRevive Analytics".  The document describes a scenario where ReceiptRevive Analytics, a data recovery and business intelligence firm, is tasked with recovering sales data from a JSON file provided by their client, RetailFlow Inc.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Problem:** RetailFlow Inc. has a large archive of old receipts digitized using OCR.  Due to damage to some receipts, the resulting JSON data is incomplete, specifically missing the 'id' field and sometimes having truncated data.  RetailFlow needs the total sales value from these incomplete records.

**Task:** The task is to create a program that will:

1. **Parse the Sales Data:** Extract the 'sales' values from the JSON file, despite the missing 'id' field and other potential data imperfections.
2. **Data Validation and Cleanup:**  Handle incomplete data entries, focusing solely on the 'sales' values.
3. **Calculate Total Sales:** Sum all the extracted 'sales' values to get a single aggregate total.


**Data:** The data is in a JSONL file named `q-parse-partial-json.jsonl`, which is to be downloaded.  The JSON data contains 100 rows, each representing a sales entry with fields for `city`, `product`, `sales`, and `id` (although `id` is often missing).

**Benefits:** Successfully completing this task will enable RetailFlow Inc. to reconstruct historical sales data, make informed business decisions, enhance ReceiptRevive's data recovery processes, and build client trust.


**Overall:** The image presents a data analysis challenge focusing on data recovery, cleaning, and aggregation from incomplete JSON data.  The primary goal is to accurately calculate the total sales despite data imperfections.  The instructions and context provided are crucial for understanding the problem and designing a solution.

this is my data before date filter - for question 1 please conform am i doing correct. and tell how to do the date filtering as some are in mm-dd-yyyy or yyyy-mm-dd format.

as this data is less i did it manually

| SUM OF COST | 14891.00 |
| --- | --- |
| SUM OF SALES | 31004.00 |
| TOTAL | 45895.00 |
| TOTAL MARGIN | 0.351083996 |

but this is not correct please guide
The image shows a spreadsheet with data about sales and costs of a product named "Kappa" in the United Arab Emirates. 


Here's a breakdown of the columns:

* **Column H:** "Country (Normalised)" - This column consistently shows "United Arab Emirates" for all entries.

* **Column I:** "DATE" - This column lists the dates of sales transactions. The dates are formatted in a mix of YYYY-MM-DD and MM-DD-YYYY formats.

* **Column J:** "Product" - This column indicates the product sold, consistently showing "Kappa" for all entries.

* **Column K:** "Sales" - This column shows the sales figures (in some currency, likely AED given the context) for each transaction.  The values are all numeric, with two decimal places.

* **Column L:** "Cost" - This column displays the cost of goods sold (COGS) for each transaction, also numeric with two decimal places, likely in the same currency as the Sales column.


The spreadsheet is likely extracted from a larger dataset, and it seems to be a subset focused on Kappa sales in the United Arab Emirates over a period of time.  The use of "Normalised" in the country column suggests the data may have undergone some cleaning or standardization process. The light blue background behind the header row enhances readability.

@23f1003186 – thanks for flagging this. You’re right. I’ve fixed this error.
That's an emoji depicting two hands pressed together in a prayer or pleading gesture. 


Here's a breakdown of its visual features:

* **Hands:** The dominant feature is a pair of yellow hands, stylized in a simple, almost pixelated manner.  The fingers are slightly curved and pressed together, with the thumbs tucked inwards.  The skin tone is a uniform, light yellow-gold.

* **Sleeves:** The hands are partially covered by short, light blue sleeves. These sleeves have simple, blocky shapes.

* **Style:** The overall style is reminiscent of a simplified emoji, with a flat, two-dimensional look. The lines are not smooth but have a somewhat pixelated or blocky quality, characteristic of emoji design.  There's no shading or texture to speak of.

The emoji conveys a sense of supplication, hope, or reverence.  There is no text present.

@23f1003186 thanks again for flagging this. This is fixed, too.
That's an emoji depicting two hands pressed together in a prayer or pleading gesture. 


Here's a breakdown of its visual features:

* **Hands:** The dominant feature is a pair of yellow hands, stylized in a simple, almost cartoonish manner.  The fingers are somewhat blocky, not realistically detailed. They are pressed together with the palms facing each other. The fingers interlock, and there is a suggestion of joined hands.

* **Skin Tone:** The hands are a consistent, light yellowish-orange tone.

* **Sleeves:** Short, light blue sleeves are visible at the wrist of each hand, adding a touch of clothing detail. These are also simply rendered, with solid color and no further details like stitching or creases.

* **Style:** The overall style is consistent with common emoji design—simple shapes, flat coloring, and a lack of intricate shading or texture. The image resolution is fairly low, fitting the common low-resolution nature of emoji designs.

The emoji is designed to convey hope, prayer, or a request for something.  There is no text within the image itself.

Date formatted and filtered successfully
The image shows a table with sales data for Kappa products in the United Arab Emirates. The table has six columns and six rows of data. The columns are:

* **Country (Normalised):** This column shows the country where the sales occurred. All entries are "United Arab Emirates".
* **DATE:** This column shows the date of the sales transaction in YYYY-MM-DD format.
* **Product:** This column indicates the product sold, which is "Kappa" in all cases.
* **Sales:** This column shows the sales amount in the local currency.
* **Cost:** This column displays the cost associated with the sales transaction.


The data shows sales and costs for six different transactions spanning from June 4th, 2022 to February 7th, 2023.  There are filter icons (a funnel symbol) next to "DATE", "Product", and "Sales" column headers, suggesting this data is likely from a spreadsheet software application where filtering and sorting are possible. The "= " symbol after "Cost" likely indicates a formula has been used to calculate the cost values in that column.

How many units of Computer were sold in London on transactions with at least 39 units?  
please check my answer is not correct - (6193)

please guide
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a spreadsheet-like table, likely a screenshot from a data analysis or reporting tool.  The table displays data organized into columns.

**Column Headers:**

* **`_-_-city`:** This column appears to represent the city where the sales occurred.  All entries in the example are "London".  The dropdown arrow suggests there are likely other cities not shown in this snippet.

* **`_-_-product`:** This column indicates the product sold. In this example, the product is consistently "Computer".  Similar to the city column, a dropdown arrow implies other product types exist but aren't included in this view.

* **`_-_-sales`:** This column shows numerical values representing sales figures, presumably in some currency unit.  Values range from 109 to 975.


**Data Rows:**

The table consists of ten rows of data, all with the same city ("London") and product ("Computer"). Each row shows a different sales value.

**Overall Appearance:**

The table has a light gray background with darker gray grid lines.  The column headers are slightly bolder and have dropdown arrows, suggesting that filters or selections can be applied. The numbers in the "sales" column appear in a green font, possibly to highlight the numerical data.

The table suggests a simple data set tracking computer sales in London, with a potential for more detailed analysis by expanding the filters on city and product.

Hi @Algsoch

@Saransh\_Saini  
Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.

Now we are struggling with Q8.  
MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.  
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post\_id but error : **Error**: At root: Array length mismatch  
**Reason**: below query checking only 1st comment (`$[0]` refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.  
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.

```
WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;

```

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.  
May be my query is wrong or may be not.

Thankyou

@lakshaygarg654

Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.  
In this case its an ordered `post_id`

So thats where you begin:

```
SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id

```

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.

Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.  
You will still need the `post_id` for the *outermost layer* so you have to continue extracting it from the *inner layers* of the nested query.

```
...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
...

```

Then the final layer of the nest

```
...
...
(

) as max_stars
...
...

```

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)

But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.

Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.

Kind regards

Its been done. You will get a more detailed error now. And we have relaxed the number of errors allowed (it actually did have a tolerance limit but it was fairly tight)

@daksh76 thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.

If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?

Thats why you are getting the error.

Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.

Kind regards

Thank you for your response @carlton. You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:

1. **`json_extract`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
2. **`json_each`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*
3. **`json_extract_path_text`**: *“Table Function with name ‘json\_extract\_path\_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”*

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.  
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for **Q8**.

Thankyou

That's a winking emoji. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** The emoji is a circular yellow face, slightly shaded to give it a three-dimensional appearance.  The yellow is a bright, warm tone.

* **Facial Features:** It has two simple, slightly curved dark brown eyebrows, one of which is straight and the other curved down in a suggestive manner.  One eye is closed, indicating a wink, with a stylized curved line suggesting a closed eyelid.  The other eye is a simple, dark brown circle with a smaller, darker circle within it for the pupil.  It has a curved, dark brown smile.

* **Style:** The style is consistent with common emoji designs found across many digital platforms.  The features are relatively simple and cartoonish.

The image is straightforward and clearly depicts a winking face emoji.
 That's an image of a simple graphic, seemingly representing a stylized sun or star and a smaller, less prominent element. 


Here's a breakdown:

* **Large Yellow Circle:** This is the dominant feature. It's a bright, slightly blurry yellow circle, suggesting a light source or celestial body. The blurriness could be a stylistic choice or a result of the image's resolution.

* **Small Yellow Rectangle:** To the right of the large circle, there's a much smaller, rectangular yellow shape. It's less bright and less defined than the circle. It could be interpreted as a smaller satellite, a comet's tail, or simply a design element to complement the larger circle.

* **Black Background:** The entire graphic is set against a solid black background, which makes the yellow shapes stand out prominently.


The overall impression is a minimalistic, possibly symbolic image, lacking any clear text or specific context. Its meaning would depend entirely on how it is used within a larger context.
 The image shows a simple, minimalist graphic design. 


It consists of two yellow shapes on a completely black background. The larger shape is a circle, and the smaller shape is a short, slightly elongated rectangle or oval that is positioned to the right and slightly overlapping the circle. The shapes are solid yellow and have no internal details or texture.  The overall appearance suggests a stylized representation of an idea or a lightbulb with a small switch or indicator.

Nope no issues with portal for Q8
That's a close-up headshot of a man. 


Here's a description:

* **The Man:** He appears to be of South Asian descent, with dark hair, dark eyes, and a slightly darker complexion. He has a short, neat haircut. His expression is neutral to slightly serious. He's wearing a dark-colored suit jacket over a lighter-colored collared shirt. 


* **The Photo:** The photo is a standard passport or professional headshot style, with a plain, light-colored background. The focus is sharp on the man's face. The image quality is decent, but not exceptionally high resolution.  There's a small, barely legible mark or signature in the very bottom right corner, too small to decipher.

* **Overall:** The image is a typical formal portrait suitable for professional use, like a LinkedIn profile picture or identification document. There's nothing unusual or particularly distinctive about the image beyond its formal nature.

In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before **Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)** for **Theta** sold in **the US** (which may be spelled in different ways).

However, when I filter in Excel for **US** and **Theta**, there are no entries for **Sales** and **Cost**. But **0** as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect.

(I cross-checked this using GPT.)
This image presents a data cleaning and analysis challenge for RetailWise Inc., a retail analytics firm. The company has received messy sales data in an Excel file containing 1000 transaction records.  The task is to clean this data and calculate the total margin for specific transactions.

**The Problem:** The Excel data has inconsistencies in several columns:

* **Customer Name:** Contains extra spaces.
* **Country:** Uses inconsistent representations (e.g., "USA," "U.S.A," "US").
* **Date:** Uses mixed formats ("MM-DD-YYYY," "YYYY/MM/DD").
* **Product:** Includes a product code after a slash (only the name before the slash is needed).
* **Sales and Cost:** Contains extra spaces and currency symbols ("USD"); some cost values are missing.
* **TransactionID:** Inconsistent spacing.

**The Task:** The user must perform the following steps:

1. **Trim and Normalize Strings:** Remove extra spaces and standardize country names.
2. **Standardize Date Formats:** Convert dates to a consistent format (ISO 8601).
3. **Extract Product Name:** Extract only the product name from the "Product" column.
4. **Clean Sales and Cost:** Remove extra characters, convert to numerical values, and handle missing cost values (assume 50% of sales).
5. **Filter Data:** Keep only transactions meeting these criteria:
    * Date: Up to and including Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)
    * Product: "Theta"
    * Country: "US" (in any of its variations)
6. **Calculate Margin:** Calculate the overall margin using the formula: `(Total Sales - Total Cost) / Total Sales`.

**The Input:** The user is provided with a link to download the messy Excel sales data file (`-clean-up-excel-sales-data.xlsx`).

**The Question:** The final question asks for the total margin (as a percentage or decimal) for transactions meeting the specified filters.  An initial incorrect answer of "0.0" is shown.

**Other Information:** The image also highlights the benefits of data cleaning, such as improved decision-making, enhanced reporting, and streamlined operations.

I have checked your GA and I do get sales entries for the criteria in your GA.  
Please remember that this module is about data cleaning. And that data needs to be sanitised before you start filtering.

Edit: I got it correct
Here's a description of the image:

The image is a vibrant, futuristic cityscape depicted in a digital painting or rendering style. 


Here's a breakdown of its features:

* **Architecture:** The city is densely packed with towering skyscrapers, many exhibiting sleek, modern designs with neon accents of blue and pink. The buildings vary in style, some appearing more organic and others strictly geometric, creating a dynamic skyline. Some buildings have curved features, and many are lit with bright, colorful lights, suggesting a nighttime setting.  A central, tall, slender building, possibly a landmark, stands out with its vertical lighting pattern.

* **Transportation:** Elevated highways and roadways crisscross the city, with glowing streaks suggesting the movement of fast-moving vehicles (possibly flying cars). The roads are a vibrant pink and purple, contrasting with the blue lights of the buildings. The image shows several vehicles; at least two appear to be flying cars with bright headlights.

* **Atmosphere:** The overall mood is energetic and futuristic. The color palette is dominated by vibrant blues, pinks, purples, and darker shades, creating a high-contrast and dynamic scene. The sky is a blend of dark orange/reddish hues at the horizon, suggesting either sunset or a futuristic sky, and a darker blue/purple tone higher up.

* **Flying Objects:** At least three spacecraft or flying vehicles are visible in the upper portion of the image, adding to the science fiction aesthetic.  One is a prominent, large craft near the top left.

* **Details:**  Smaller details include building signage (though unreadable), and even a screen showing what might be news or advertisements on one of the buildings in the mid-right.

The entire image suggests a bustling, technologically advanced city where air and ground transportation are seamlessly integrated.  It strongly evokes a cyberpunk or science fiction setting, possibly from a video game or movie.

this is my image i coded corrrect mapped to correct pixel but it was saying pixel do not match what is meaning of it
Here's a description of the image:

The image is a complex collage or montage, seemingly a poster or artwork, composed of numerous smaller, square and rectangular sections.  The overall style is steampunk or Art Deco influenced, using a sepia tone and brown color palette with detailed linework. The aesthetic is reminiscent of vintage engineering diagrams, technical drawings, and possibly biographical information.

**Recurring Elements:**

* **Gears and Mechanical Components:**  Various gears, cogs, and other mechanical parts are scattered throughout, implying a technological or industrial theme.

* **Portraits:**  Multiple portraits of men appear, some in formal attire, others seemingly more casual.  These portraits seem to be presented in a stylized, almost infographic manner.

* **Textual Information:**  Numerous text boxes are included, containing titles, names (like "USTY IMA", "A SUTICAE", "VITYG CHAN"), labels, possibly job descriptions,  and what appears to be technical data, numbers, and other information. Some text is easily readable, while some is smaller or stylized and harder to decipher.  The language seems to be English, but some words might be stylized or invented for aesthetic effect.

* **Biographical Elements:** The organization of the image suggests a presentation of various individuals, with perhaps details of their background, accomplishments, or skills. It might represent a team, a company profile, or perhaps a fictional collective.


**Structure:**

The sections of the collage are densely packed, and the layout isn't easily interpreted as linear narrative. However, a general organizational pattern is suggested by the technical diagrams, potentially connecting the individuals represented within the collage.

**Overall Impression:**

The image appears to be sophisticated, designed to convey information in a visually interesting way. It's not clear from the image alone what the final purpose or meaning is.  The sepia tone and mechanical details give a sense of vintage technology or a retro-futuristic feel.  The inclusion of portraits suggests some degree of narrative or biographical intent.

For Q8, I wrote the following query,

```
SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id;

```

What it does is for each post\_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post\_id. Finally returns all the post\_id’s in ascending order.

But it’s giving me an `Array length mismatch` error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. @Jivraj @carlton

P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.

    * Buttons to "Check all" and "Save" the answer.
    * An "Error: Incorrect answer" message.
    * A "Check" button to resubmit an answer.


* **System Information:** In the bottom-right corner, a system tray is visible displaying time (12:24), date (21-02-2025), language (ENG/IN), and network connection status.  There's also a temperature display (28°C, Partly sunny).


In summary, the image captures a student working on a data analysis task involving processing log files to count successful GET requests based on specific criteria. The student's initial attempt was incorrect, and they are presented with an opportunity to refine their answer.

Hi @23f3004114

Question 9 might not be solved 100% automatically, Manually listen to audio once or twice and correct few things.

Kind regards

**Q9**

Note : I found that punctuations are also checked. So make sure you include punctuations inside the paragraph wherever it is effective according to the voice in the paragraph

@21f3001379 @Jivraj , thank you for the replies . i stopped after 8/10. need to prepare for Quiz 1.
That's a simple digital drawing or graphic of a heart. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a classic heart shape, slightly rounded and not perfectly symmetrical. The color is a vibrant, slightly glossy red. The shading suggests a three-dimensional effect, with a subtle highlight at the top curves making it appear slightly puffy or plump.

* **Style:** The style is reminiscent of pixel art or a simple vector graphic, with a slightly low resolution or pixelated look. The edges are not perfectly smooth.


There is no text or other objects present in the image, only the heart itself.

**QUESTION 9**

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.

Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "

I had exams and would like do week 4,week 5 before week 6 and doing the assignment is a huge part in learning, any on the just doing the assignments or answers for the assignments?

Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.32.27 AM776×876 79.9 KB

  
recent score shows the points, but overall score is 0. Please take a look.
Here's a description of the image:

The image shows a screen capture of what appears to be an online exam or quiz platform. 


Here's a breakdown of the visible content:

* **Header:**  At the top, it displays "Ended at Fri, 21 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST", indicating the completion time of the assessment. A "Score: 0" is shown, along with buttons labeled "Check all" and "Save". The title "TDS 2025 Jan GAS - Data н" is prominently displayed, suggesting a specific assessment name or code.

* **Instructions:** A numbered list provides instructions to the user:
    * Learn what's needed, feel free to skip reading material.
    * Check answers regularly using the "Check" button.
    * Save answers regularly using the "Save" button.
    * Reloading is okay; answers are saved in the browser.
    * Browser issues may occur; turn off security restrictions if necessary.
    * Use any resources you want (Internet, ChatGPT, etc.).
    * The quiz is "hackable," implying that the code can be manipulated to find answers.

* **Discourse Link:** A button prompts users with questions to join a discussion on Discourse.

* **Login Status:** The platform confirms the user's login: "You are logged in as 23f1002709@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" with a "Logout" button.

* **Recent Saves:** A section displays recent saved attempts, showing the timestamp and score for each. The text clarifies that the most recent save reflects the official score.

* **Buttons:**  Buttons like "Reload", "Check all", and "Save" are present.


The overall style is dark-themed, with a clean and relatively simple layout. The instructions are clear and straightforward, and the presence of a Discourse link suggests a community aspect to the platform. The mention of "hackable" implies a certain level of openness or challenge related to the quiz's design.
