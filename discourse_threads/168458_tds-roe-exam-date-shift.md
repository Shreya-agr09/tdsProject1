@carlton @jkmadathil Sir please shift the ROE date to another date because we really need time to understand all these stuffs as these are so hard for beginners like us and there is quiz 2 and we have to prepare for that also.  
Sir please understand our situation and pay attention to our concern.

Also, it seems impossible to complete it in 45 minutes.

you got the wrong Anand here. You perhaps wanted to tag the faculty of this course s.anand (I’m purposely not tagging him; you may do so)

I feel for you because you constantly get incorrectly tagged. On the plus side you are famous (or infamous depending on perspective  )

That's a winking emoticon, specifically a version of the "Winking Face" emoji. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** It's a circular yellow face, rendered in a style typical of emojis. The yellow has a slight gradient, appearing slightly brighter in the center.

* **Facial Features:** The face has a simple, cartoonish design. It features:
    * **One closed eye:** One eye is completely closed, indicating a wink.
    * **One open eye:** The other eye is partially open, showing a pupil and some highlight.
    * **Slightly curved, upward-pointing smile:** A simple, dark brown, curved line suggests a happy, playful expression. 
    * **Eyebrows:** Two short, dark brown, slightly curved lines above the open eye create the impression of eyebrows.

* **Overall Impression:** The emoji conveys a playful, mischievous, or friendly feeling. The wink suggests a sense of humor or inside joke.

Just FYI the correct tag to use for Professor Anand of TDS is @s.anand

Also ROE date will not be moved because its an exam date that has been set before the term starts. This is just part of the policy of the BS Programme. Exam dates never get moved except in truly exceptional circumstances.

Sir can you at least increase the time limit from 45 minutes to 1 hour?

The time limit for ROE will be set according to the difficulty level of the ROE.

That's a digital image of a winking emoticon, also known as an emoji. 


Here's a description:

* **Shape and Color:** The emoji is a bright yellow circle, resembling a simplified cartoon face. 

* **Facial Features:** It has two simple, curved dark-brown eyebrows, one of which is slightly more raised than the other.  One eye is closed in a wink, represented by a curved line suggesting a closed eyelid. The other eye is a simple dark-brown oval. The mouth is a curved dark-brown line, suggesting a happy smile.  There's a small dark-brown dot in the open eye, possibly representing a pupil or highlight.

* **Style:** The style is consistent with commonly used emojis found on most digital platforms. The features are minimal and stylized, not realistic.

* **Background:** The background is transparent, which is typical for digitally shared emojis so that they can be placed on various backgrounds without a jarring color clash.
